// PATCH /api/invites/{inviteId} — the owner editing ONE accepted grant's
// capabilities in place (MYR-369, rest-api.md §7.5.7).
//
// This endpoint is what replaced the pre-MYR-369 rule that a grant's access was
// fixed for its life and changing it meant revoke-plus-reinvite. It is ACCESS
// CONTROL and is written for adversarial reading:
//
//   - OWNER-ONLY, enforced IN THE SQL (`owner_user_id = $n` on the UPDATE
//     itself). Like ServeRevoke and ServeResend it does NOT pre-read the row to
//     check ownership: a read-then-write would add a window and a second thing
//     to disagree, and would buy nothing the predicate does not already give.
//   - 404-INDISTINGUISHABILITY IS PRESERVED. A missing invite, another owner's
//     invite, and a revoked tombstone all answer 404 with one body, so this
//     endpoint cannot be used to probe for other people's invite ids — exactly
//     the property DELETE and resend already hold.
//   - ATOMIC. One conditional UPDATE with RETURNING; the response echoes the row
//     the DATABASE now holds rather than a Go-side reconstruction of the request,
//     so a concurrent edit is reported honestly instead of being papered over.
//   - PARTIAL means partial. An absent key leaves that capability untouched; it
//     is NOT the same as sending `false`. Pointer fields on the request struct
//     are what carry the distinction, and an entirely empty body is 400 rather
//     than a successful no-op.

// ServePatch handles PATCH /api/invites/{inviteId}.
//
// 200 with the updated ShareInvite. Errors:
//   - 400 invalid_request — malformed body, or a body that changes nothing.
//   - 404 not_found — missing / foreign / revoked, indistinguishably.
//   - 409 conflict — the invite is still PENDING. A pending row has no grant to
//     edit; its access is decided at redemption from the invite's preset, so the
//     owner cancels and re-sends instead. Told plainly because the caller
//     demonstrably owns the row, so there is nothing left to hide.

	// as it is for a revoke: the cache is what the WebSocket handshake and
	// every per-vehicle handler consult, so a stale entry IS a live grant for
	// up to the TTL.
	//
	// UNCONDITIONAL — every successful patch busts, not only the suspending
	// one. A bust conditional on which field moved is a rule that can be got
	// wrong by the next person to add a field; an unconditional one cannot,
	// and the cost is one dropped cache entry on an already-rare owner action.

	//   - Suspension is the only flag on this endpoint that removes the
	//     grant from the viewer-merge access set, which is the single thing
	//     the WS handshake resolves through. Losing it is what has to stop a
	//     live stream.
	//   - allowRides governs the §7.8 ride surface and has NO WebSocket
	//     effect whatsoever. Closing a socket over it would drop a viewer's
	//     live map for a change that does not touch the live map.
	//
	// Read off the ROW the database returned rather than off the request, so
	// an already-suspended grant patched for some other reason still closes
	// (harmless, and the alternative is trusting the request to describe the
	// resulting state). A patch that lifts a suspension leaves Suspended
	// false and closes nothing — restoring access has no socket to end.

		// LIFTING A SUSPENSION IS A WIDENING (MYR-601), and it is the exact
		// mirror of the branch above rather than an afterthought: suspension is
		// the one flag on this endpoint that moves the vehicle in or out of the
		// grantee's access set, so restoring it puts the car back — and the
		// grantee's already-open socket, whose set was frozen while they were
		// suspended, would otherwise stay dark until it reconnected.
		//
		// The condition is READ OFF THE REQUEST, not off the row, and that is
		// the one asymmetry with the narrowing above. `row.Grant.Suspended ==
		// false` is also true of a patch that only touched allowRides, and
		// re-handshaking a viewer over a flag with no WebSocket effect at all
		// would be a disconnect bought with nothing. Only a patch that ASKED to
		// un-suspend widens; an un-suspend of an already-live grant is a
		// harmless extra reconnect, which is the same trade the narrowing makes
		// in its direction.

	// The invite id and what changed — never the label (P1), and there is no

	//
	// MYR-451 WIDENED THIS DELIBERATELY, and the reason is worth keeping. The
	// line used to carry the invite id and the two resulting flags, which is
	// enough to know a patch happened and useless for the question an incident
	// actually asks: WHICH PERSON lost WHICH capability on WHICH CAR, and did
	// that precede or follow the ride they took. An invite id joins to none of
	// that without a database the on-call may not have, and by then the row has
	// moved on — a revoked grant answers 404 and a re-invite reuses nothing.
	//
	// So the line now names the grantee and the vehicle, which are exactly the
	// two keys denyVehicleAccess and the create-path decision log key on. The
	// three lines join on (user_id, vehicle_id) and reconstruct the timeline
	// from logs alone. `requested_*` records what the owner ASKED FOR (nil for
	// an absent field, which is not the same as false) beside what the row now
	// HOLDS, so a partial patch reads unambiguously and a request that changed
	// nothing is visible as such rather than looking like a fresh decision.

// (`0xc000…`), and the two disagreeing is discovered during an incident, on the
// one line that was supposed to settle the incident. Rendering the distinction
// ourselves makes the attribute identical under every handler.
//
// An absent field logs "unchanged" rather than being omitted or logged as
// false. Omission would make a partial patch indistinguishable from one that
