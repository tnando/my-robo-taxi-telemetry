// The MEMBER MERGE for GET /api/vehicles (MYR-540).
//
// A group-ride joiner holds live access to the ride's vehicle — the WS
// handshake admits them through internal/auth's membership leg — but the
// catalog is what the app's watched-vehicle ladder resolves against, and a car
// the catalog omits is a car the app treats as gone. This file appends the
// vehicles of LIVE rides the caller has joined as `role: "viewer"` rows, after
// the owner and shared halves, so the three surfaces (catalog, access set,
// role resolution) name the same cars for the same caller.
//
// Membership rows carry the ZERO grant — no ride capability — matching the WS
// side: riding in a car buys watching it, never booking it. And they are
// DEDUPLICATED against the rows already in hand: a caller who owns the car
// keeps their owner row, a caller with a share keeps the share's richer
// capability row, and the member row appears only when membership is the ONLY
// relationship — which is exactly the joiner this merge exists for.
//
// MYR-602 CHANGED THE MASK THESE ROWS ARE PROJECTED THROUGH, from `viewer` to
// `ride_member`, and the change is what keeps this merge doing its job. The
// narrowing took `location` off the plain-viewer catalog row; a member row
// projected through the viewer mask would therefore have arrived at the rider's
// picker with no coordinate, and the picker's per-row pickup ETA (MYR-577)
// would have gone blank for the one car the rider is actually in — a
// regression no owner-side test could have caught. The WIRE role these rows
// carry is still `viewer`; only the field set is the elevated one.

// RideMemberVehicleLister returns viewer-shaped catalog rows for the vehicles
// of live group rides the caller has joined. Implementations apply the
// live-membership join themselves (the join is the access check), so a ride
// that has ended yields no row — access expires with the ride, with nothing to
// revoke.
