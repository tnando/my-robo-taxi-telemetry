// POST /api/ride-requests/join — the JOINER-side redemption of a group ride's
// shared link (MYR-540, rest-api.md §7.24, contracts $defs.RideRequestJoinRequest).
//
// It mirrors POST /api/invites/redeem (§7.5.5) rule for rule, because it is the
// same act with a different subject: a code, held by whoever received the link,
// exchanged for access. Same body-not-path placement, same normalization, same
// per-user rate limit, same deliberate indistinguishability of every dead code.
//
// WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS THE RESPONSE. The sharing redeem needed its own response
// shape because ShareInvite is owner-facing and could never be handed to the
// redeemer; the ride a joiner joins IS the object they are now a party to, so
// the 200 body is the full RideRequest with the caller already in `members` —
// and the joiner goes straight to the rider tracking surface with no second
// round trip.
//
// AUTHENTICATED, and that is a product decision before it is an implementation
// one (client, 2026-08-13): app plus sign-in are required, the joining account
// is the JWT subject and is never client-supplied, and live car positions never
// render on the open web. The web landing shell at /ride/{code} verifies the
// link's SIGNATURE statically against a compiled-in public key and then hands
// the bare code here; the signature proves the link came from this server, and
// this endpoint is the only thing that decides whether it still means anything.
