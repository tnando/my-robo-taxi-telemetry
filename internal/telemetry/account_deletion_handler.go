// AccountDeletionHandler serves DELETE /api/users/me — user-initiated account
// deletion (MYR-355; FR-10.1/FR-10.2; rest-api.md §7.6; data-lifecycle.md §3).
// It is an App Store review requirement: an app that creates accounts must
// offer in-app account deletion.
//
// WHO SERVES THIS. rest-api.md §7.6 originally assigned the endpoint to the
// Next.js app, on the reading that the Prisma `$transaction` was the deletion.
// The native iOS client (P9) never talks to the Next.js app at all, and the
// data that must go now lives largely in Go-owned tables the Prisma cascade
// cannot reach (go_ride_requests, go_vehicle_shares, go_push_devices,
// go_refresh_tokens, go_users, go_identity_apple, go_removed_vehicles). So the
// Go server serves it, and the §3.1 `account_deleted` audit row moves with it.
//
// THE SEQUENCE, and why it is not one transaction. See
// store.AccountDeleter's type doc for the full reasoning; the short form is
// that the per-vehicle teardown is ALREADY its own transaction (it takes FOR
// UPDATE locks and fires a NOTIFY that must not observe uncommitted work) and
// the ride cancellation publishes push notifications. Instead of one-shot
// atomicity the endpoint guarantees that every step is idempotent and the
// whole sequence is RE-RUNNABLE:
//
//  1. Count drives (audit metadata only; a failure here is not fatal). Then,
//     still inside step 1 and numbered 1b/1c in the code: read the owned fleet
//     ONCE — id and VIN, so the two steps that follow agree on which cars they
//     are about — and DELETE each of those cars' fleet-telemetry config AT
//     TESLA (MYR-593), through the same StreamConfigTeardown the per-vehicle
//     teardown endpoint uses. That config delete is the FIRST Tesla call of the
//     sequence and has to be: step 2 revokes the grant and step 3 deletes the
//     tokens, so after either there is nothing left to authenticate it with.
//     Skipping it is a pure cost leak — the config outlives the account by up
//     to 350 days, still streaming and still billing, and unreachable the
//     moment the Vehicle row is gone.
//  2. Revoke the Tesla OAuth grant AT TESLA (MYR-366), while the stored
//     refresh token still exists to present. Best-effort and non-fatal:
//     Tesla's availability must not be able to block a person's deletion of
//     their own account.
//  3. Tear down every owned vehicle, one existing owner_teardown transaction
//     per car. Each removes the Vehicle + cascade, deletes that car's
//     go_ride_requests, revokes every sharing grant ON the car (MYR-184),
//     tombstones the VIN (MYR-261) and, on the last car, clears the Tesla
//     Account tokens + resets Settings. Idempotent: AlreadyGone is success.
//  4. Revoke the grants the caller RECEIVED (shares-received → tombstones).
//  5. Scrub the owner-typed label off those same received grants (MYR-447).
//     Step 4 tombstones the ACCESS but leaves the NAME: `label` is a third
//     party's free-text name for this person, typed by the car owner, and
//     before MYR-447 it survived the deletion indefinitely. Keyed on the
//     person rather than the status, so it also reaches grants that were
//     already revoked — which step 4, being idempotency-guarded, skips.
//  6. Cancel the caller's OPEN rides as RIDER, through the guarded status
//     transition, publishing ride_status_changed so the affected owners are
//     notified by the standard lifecycle pushes.
//  7. Delete the caller's push devices.
//  8. Delete the caller's saved Home/Work places (MYR-321) — personal effects
//     with no counterparty, and the one step whose rows are encrypted GPS of
//     where the person lives, so they must not outlive the account.
//  9. Revoke the caller's refresh tokens.
//  10. Delete the identity rows (go_identity_apple, go_users) and the Prisma
//     "User" row if one exists — ONE transaction, with the account_deleted
//     audit row written first (CG-DL-3).
//  11. Invalidate the auth caches so the caller's unexpired access token stops
//     validating immediately.
//
// The order is load-bearing in one specific way: the identity rows the caller
// authenticates WITH are deleted LAST. A failure at any earlier step therefore
// leaves an account that can still call this endpoint again and finish the
// job — which is exactly what the client does on the retry path.
//
// RIDE HISTORY IS NOT DELETED. Terminal ride rows (completed / declined /
// cancelled) where the caller was the RIDER are counterparty records: they are
// the OWNER's history of their own car, and erasing them would delete someone
// else's data. They stay, with rider_id left pointing at a cuid that no longer
// resolves. That is the whole mechanism: requesterIdentitySelect's
// `requester_exists` probe goes false, the scanner leaves RequesterName empty,
// and the wire OMITS `requesterName` — which the client renders as "Former
// rider". No column was added and no row was rewritten; the MYR-264 fallback
// already had exactly this case in it, and MYR-355 only pins it with a test.
