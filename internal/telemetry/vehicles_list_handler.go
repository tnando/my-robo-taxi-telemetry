// VehicleCatalogRow is the slim per-vehicle shape the list handler
// consumes from its VehicleLister dependency. Mirrors the subset of
// `store.Vehicle` fields the catalog response surfaces (no GPS, no
// nav, no climate). Defined here so the handler can stay decoupled
// from `internal/store` and avoid the import cycle that arises when
// `internal/telemetry` depends on `internal/store` (the telemetry
// package is already imported by store-adjacent code through
// `cmd/ops`).

	ChargeLevel    int

	// HasActiveRide is derived read-time by the store's list query
	// (MYR-233), not persisted on the vehicle: true iff the car holds
	// an open INSTANT ride request (`accepted` / `enroute` / `arrived`,
	// `scheduled_for IS NULL`) — the same predicate the per-vehicle
	// accept guard races on.
	HasActiveRide bool

	// MYR-316 service window: the two RAW sources behind the single wire
	// field serviceEstimatedEndAt, LEFT JOINed from the Go-owned control-state
	// side table. ServiceETC (Tesla) takes precedence over
	// ServiceExpectedEndAt (owner-entered); the wire value is resolved from
	// these plus Status and is never emitted raw.
	ServiceETC           *time.Time
	ServiceExpectedEndAt *time.Time

	// RideShareEnabled is the owner's ride-sharing switch (MYR-342), LEFT
	// JOINed from the same control-state row as the service window. Unlike the
	// two above it is emitted RAW — there is nothing to resolve, no precedence
	// and no status gate: the owner's answer is the wire value. The store's
	// COALESCE makes a car with no side-table row read true, so the zero value
	// this struct can hold on a hand-built row means PAUSED; every real
	// construction site goes through the adapter and carries the joined value.
	RideShareEnabled bool

	// TrimLabel is the DISPLAY-SAFE trim label (MYR-507), LEFT JOINed from the
	// same control-state row as the two above. Emitted RAW like
	// RideShareEnabled — there is nothing to resolve and no status gate — and it
	// is the SAME COLUMN /snapshot emits as VehicleState.trimLabel (MYR-320),
	// read rather than re-derived, so the catalog and the detail sheet cannot
	// name the same car two different things.
	//
	// Nil means Tesla has not told us the trim yet, and that is NOT the empty
	// string: a descriptor built from it must drop the fragment entirely rather
	// than render a stray separator.
	//
	// MYR-578: no longer emitted verbatim — `newVehicleSummary` resolves the
	// wire value through `internal/trim` (label → badge → VIN drive-unit), so a
	// junk stored label ("Base2024") or an absent one no longer decides what a
	// car is called when the badge or the VIN knows better.
	TrimLabel *string

	// Trim is the RAW BADGE CODE ("p100d"), MYR-578's second resolver rung.
	// NEVER emitted on this surface — input only.
	Trim *string

	// OwnerFirstName is the FIRST NAME of the person who owns this car
	// (MYR-581), resolved by the store's three-source identity ladder and
	// already reduced to its first token before it crosses this boundary — the
	// full name never reaches this package.
	//
	// Emitted RAW (there is nothing left to resolve), as
	// `VehicleSummary.ownerFirstName`. Nil means the owner has no resolvable
	// name in any identity source, which is a real and common state and NOT the
	// empty string: a descriptor built from it must drop the whole possessive
	// fragment rather than render "'s Model X".
	//
	// P1. NEVER logged.
	OwnerFirstName *string

	// TelemetrySuspendedAt is when owner-inactivity suspension removed this
	// car's fleet-telemetry config (MYR-592), or nil while streaming is
	// configured normally. Formatted to RFC 3339 at the wire layer, like the
	// sibling service window.
	TelemetrySuspendedAt *time.Time

	// Latitude / Longitude are the car's freshest known position (MYR-515),
	// already decrypted by the store from the SAME `latitudeEnc`/`longitudeEnc`
	// pair the /snapshot serves. An ATOMIC PAIR: both set or both nil.
	//
	// RAW, in the sense that no privacy transform is applied — but NOT emitted
	// verbatim: newVehicleSummary collapses the (0, 0) no-fix sentinel to a null
	// `location`, because a catalog row must never hand a picker a coordinate in
	// the Gulf of Guinea to measure an ETA against.
	Latitude  *float64
	Longitude *float64

	// SetupSchedule is the car's fleet-config schedule row (MYR-491), LEFT
	// JOINed from go_fleet_config_attempts. RAW, like the service-window pair:
	// the wire field `setupState` is DERIVED from it together with Status and
	// LastUpdated. The catalog carries it so the rider-side picker can render a
	// shared car as "setting up" instead of "offline" (MYR-437) without a
	// snapshot fetch per row. Zero value means "no claim" — the safe reading.
	SetupSchedule VehicleSetupSchedule

	// DriverAccess is the car's go_vehicle_driver_access row (MYR-599), LEFT
	// JOINed alongside the schedule on all three §7.0 producers. RAW STORAGE
	// behind TWO derived wire values: `teslaAccessType` and the
	// `awaiting_owner_acknowledgment` member of `setupState`. Zero value reads
	// as owner access — safe for the wire, and see the type's own doc for the
	// direction in which it is NOT safe.
