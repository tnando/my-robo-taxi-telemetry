// Fleet-config reconciler — the recovery path for MYR-448.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Self-serve onboarding pushes a car's fleet-telemetry config
// exactly once, from inside the Tesla OAuth callback (`ownerStreamHook.
// AfterLink`). At that instant the owner CANNOT have paired the virtual key —
// pairing is a later step, performed by hand in the Tesla app at
// tesla.com/_ak/myrobotaxi.app. Tesla therefore answers that push with HTTP
// 200 and `skipped_vehicles: {vin: "missing_key"}`, the config is not applied,
// and nothing in the system ever tries again. The car never streams. Every
// external beta owner hit this.
//
// docs/architecture/self-serve-onboarding.md §5 already specified the missing
// half — "The push is safe to attempt pre-pairing (Tesla no-ops / errors for
// an unpaired VIN); it is retried when pairing completes." — but no retry was
// ever built. This is that retry, and it is a RECONCILER rather than an
// event hook because there is no event to hang it on: pairing happens inside
// Tesla's app and our server is never told.
//
// SHAPE. A slow background loop. Each pass asks Tesla for the authoritative
// per-VIN config state and re-pushes only what is genuinely unconfigured, so a
// healthy fleet costs one cheap read per quiet car and zero writes.
//
// SCHEDULING LIVES IN OUR OWN TABLE, not in "Vehicle"."lastUpdated" — see
// migration 0031. Ordering candidates by a column the reconciler cannot change
// means every car it fails to fix sorts first forever and permanently occupies
// the per-pass limit. go_fleet_config_attempts both guarantees coverage and
// carries the exponential backoff that keeps an unpairable car from costing a
// signed POST every 15 minutes for the rest of time.
//
// SAFETY. The reconciler performs a state-changing call against a real car, so
// cmd/ constructs it ONLY when the tesla-http-proxy and telemetry endpoint are
// configured — the same runtime guard that keeps live pushes out of dev/test
// (self-serve-onboarding.md §5 SAFETY).
