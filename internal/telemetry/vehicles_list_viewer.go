// The VIEWER MERGE for GET /api/vehicles (MYR-91, delivered by MYR-184).
//
// Before this, the list endpoint had a standing note saying viewer-merged
// enumeration was "PLANNED" and every caller got only vehicles they owned —
// which meant a rider who redeemed an invite saw an empty garage. This file is
// the other half: shared vehicles are appended as `role: "viewer"` rows
// carrying their `sharePermission`, projected through the VIEWER mask.
//
// Owner rows are untouched. They are built by the same newVehicleSummary as
// before, projected through the same owner mask, and emitted first — a caller
// with no shares sees a byte-identical response to the pre-MYR-184 one.

// SharedVehicleLister returns the caller's viewer-shaped catalog rows.
// Implementations apply the accepted-grant join themselves, so an id the
// caller has no grant on — or holds only a SUSPENDED grant on (MYR-369) —
// yields no row: the id list narrows an access-checked query and never
// substitutes for the check.

// SharedVehicleRow is a catalog row plus the RIDE CAPABILITY the caller holds

// it — the lister's join excludes suspended grants — so there is no default to
// invent and no suspension to re-check here.

//
// The mask is the real gate, not the struct: a field added to vehicleSummary
// without a matching allow-list entry is dropped rather than silently leaked.
// Used by every non-owner merge leg and by the redeem response, so a redeemer
// cannot see one field more on the join screen than in their catalog a second
// later.
//
// MYR-602 SPLIT THE ROLE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE, and keeping the two apart is
// the whole job of this function:
//
//   - THE MASK ROLE is the resolved internal role. It decides the FIELDS, and
//     since MYR-602 that decision differs: a plain viewer's row carries no
//     `location`, a ride member's and a trip participant's do. Passing
//     RoleViewer here for a ride member — which is what this function did
//     before the split — would silently take the coordinate away from every
//     rider mid-ride, with every owner-side test still green.
//   - THE WIRE ROLE is what `VehicleSummary.role` says, and it stays the v1
//     enum `owner | viewer` (vehicle-summary.schema.json). The internal names
//     are an RBAC implementation detail; emitting one would break every client
//     decoding a closed enum, for a distinction the client already reads off
//     `activeTripId` and `hasActiveRide`. wireRole is the ONE projection, and
//     TestWireRoleNeverEmitsAnInternalRoleName pins that it is total.
//
// The v1 viewer allow-list otherwise subtracts nothing from the owner list and
// adds `sharePermission` — including `name`, the owner-curated nickname the
// rider UI renders as "{Owner}'s {Vehicle}". Every field
// vehicle-summary.schema.json marks `required` must survive this projection, or
// the rows this function emits are invalid against the shape their own consumer
// decodes. Asserted in vehicles_list_viewer_schema_test.go.
