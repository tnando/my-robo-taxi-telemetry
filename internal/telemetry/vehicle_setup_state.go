// The MYR-491 owner-facing SETUP STATE — one derivation, two read surfaces.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. MYR-489 taught the server to heal a car that was linked but
// never streamed; it deliberately left the wire untouched. The consequence
// showed up the next night (MYR-503): a brand-new owner opened the app, saw a
// vehicle card with no location and no charge, tapped Lock, and got a dead
// button — because nothing on the wire said "your virtual key is not paired
// yet". The client's instruction was explicit: do NOT hang pairing guidance off
// a failed control ("does this make sense to the end user to have retry
// associated with lock?" — no). The card must render BEFORE any command is
// attempted, and it must name the ONE thing left to do.
//
// So the server publishes the state and the client renders copy. This file is
// the ONLY place the state is decided; both the §7.1 snapshot and the §7.0
// catalog row call it with the same inputs, which is why they cannot disagree
// and why no client ever re-derives it.
//
// THE HONESTY BAR. Every state here is a CLAIM about a real car in front of a
// real owner, so the rule is: say nothing unless there is specific evidence,
// and never say something a longer-lived fact would contradict. Three
// consequences, each of which cost a design round:
//
//  1. ABSENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE. A car with no schedule row gets no state. The
//     row is self-draining (a successful config push DELETEs it — migration
//     0031), so "no row" means healthy OR not yet examined, and neither
//     licenses a setup card.
//  2. `configuring` MUST NOT OUTLIVE ITS EVIDENCE. It is the only state that
//     claims progress rather than naming a blocker, so it requires a live
//     pairing epoch or a fresh forced re-push and expires with them. A card
//     that says "connecting…" for a week is a lie told slowly.
//  3. A CAR THAT STREAMED ONCE AND WENT QUIET IS NOT "SETTING UP". That is the
//     freshness story (`lastUpdated`), it has its own UI, and letting it leak
//     in here would put a setup card on every car parked in a basement garage.
//     The streaming gate below is what keeps the two apart.
//
// NOT DERIVED FROM `key_not_paired` COMMAND REJECTIONS, and that is deliberate
// rather than an omission — the issue names them as a candidate source. The
// wserrors code is OVERLOADED: internal/commands/executor.go returns the very
// same `key_not_paired` when OUR signing proxy is unconfigured
// (`errKeyNotPaired("vehicle command signing is not configured (no proxy)")`),
// with no virtual key involved at all. Deriving "go pair your key in the Tesla
// app" from it would tell every owner in the fleet to re-pair whenever our own
// deployment loses its proxy — the worst possible failure for a card whose
// entire job is naming the ONE thing left to do. Tesla's `missing_key` on the
// config push carries no such ambiguity, so that is the evidence used, and
// owner_stream_hook seeds it at link time so it is present within seconds of
// onboarding rather than after the reconciler's first pass.

	//     first would blind the state for any car whose seed write failed, i.e.
	//     exactly the best-effort write we promise never to gate on.
	//  2. NOTHING HAS BEEN PUSHED AT THIS CAR, so `awaiting_virtual_key`,
	//     `configuring` and `token_failed` cannot truthfully apply — all three
	//     are claims ABOUT A PUSH. A driver who paired their key (Tesla makes

	//     thing to do here and someone else's approval is what it rests on.
	//
