// FleetConfigPusher installs a vehicle's fleet-telemetry config at Tesla —
// EXACTLY the call first pairing makes, minus the OAuth. Satisfied by the same
// cmd/-level pusher the link-time hook and the MYR-448 reconciler use, so there
// is one construction of the config request in the process and not two that
// drift on a field-map change.
//
// Nil means the tesla-http-proxy is unconfigured. The route is still mounted —
// see the handler's Enablement note.

// VehicleReconnectHandler serves
// POST /api/tesla/vehicles/{vehicleId}/reconnect — the owner's way back from an
// inactivity suspension (MYR-592, rest-api.md §7.28).
//
// ── WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT IS SO SMALL ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// The suspension sweeper removes exactly ONE thing: the vehicle's
// fleet-telemetry config at Tesla. The OAuth grant, the virtual key, the
// `Vehicle` row, every share and every ride survive it. So the way back is to
// put that one thing back — and nothing else. There is no OAuth round trip, no
// consent screen, no lock/unlock dance, no re-pairing: those belong to FIRST
// pairing, and the contract (vehicle-summary.schema.json) makes the seamlessness
// of this call the whole justification for suspending narrowly in the first
// place.
//
// ── THE TWO OFFERS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The contract requires the owner's disconnect notice to carry exactly two:
// RE-CONNECT (this endpoint) and UNLINK COMPLETELY (the §7.12 teardown, which
// already clears the same episode row). This is the first of the pair; nothing
// here is a partial teardown, and there is deliberately no third option.
//
// ── ORDER: TESLA FIRST, THEN THE STAMP ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The push runs BEFORE the episode is cleared, mirroring the sweeper's
// delete-then-stamp. Clearing first would produce the state the platform cannot
// explain from the other direction: a catalog saying "connected" for a car with
// no config, an owner with no notice, and nothing left to press. In this order a
// failure leaves the suspension visible and the button live, which is exactly
// what a person who just failed to reconnect should see.
//
// ── OWNERSHIP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Identical to §7.12 / §7.14 / §7.15 / §7.16 / §7.18: unknown vehicleId →
// `404 not_found`, INDISTINGUISHABLE from a vehicle the caller simply cannot
// see; a real ownership mismatch → `403 vehicle_not_owned`. Neither writes
// anything and neither reaches Tesla. The distinction earns its keep here for
// the same reason it does on the pause switch: a VIEWER holding the top `rides`
// tier reaches this endpoint legitimately authenticated and must still be
// refused — the suspension followed the OWNER's inactivity and the bill is the
// owner's, so a rider restarting it would be spending somebody else's money.
