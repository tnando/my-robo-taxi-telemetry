// RideRequestHandler serves the rider-facing ride-request REST surface
// (P10, MYR-174): POST /api/ride-requests (create), POST
// /api/ride-requests/{id}/cancel, GET /api/ride-requests/{id} (party-only),
// GET /api/ride-requests (rider's own list). The owner-facing surface
// (incoming feed, accept/decline — MYR-175) is served by the sibling
// RideRequestOwnerHandler.
//
// Authorization model. The create access check is the vehicle owner OR a
// viewer holding an accepted share at the `rides` tier — the top tier, whose
// entire increment over `live_history` is exactly this: "send the car to pick
// them up".
//
// MYR-184 CORRECTED THE PREDICTION THIS COMMENT USED TO MAKE. It previously
// said shared-viewer requests would "land when the access set widens, with no
// change to this handler". That was wrong, and rest-api.md §7.8 repeated the
// same error. The owner-equality check below is a SEPARATE code path from the
// read-side access set: widening GetUserVehicles put shared cars in a viewer's
// list and let them read the snapshot, but this check would still have refused
// every one of their ride requests. Granting `rides` required changing it, and
// this is that change.
//
// The ride's ownerId is still the VEHICLE's owner, never the requester, so a
// rider≠owner request routes to the car's owner for accept/decline exactly as
// an owner's own request does.

// ServeCancel handles POST /api/ride-requests/{id}/cancel. PARTY-AWARE from
// MYR-522 (client decision, 2026-08-12: "add ability for owner to cancel ride
// from their end as well"):
//
//   - The RIDER may cancel from ANY live status — requested, accepted,
//     arrived, even enroute with themselves aboard (MYR-537, client directive
//     2026-08-12: "Allow rider to cancel ride at anytime even after it's
//     started"). A mid-ride cancel cannot clear the car's dash nav (Tesla has
//     no cancel-navigation API), so the owner's push is the stand-down.
//   - The OWNER may cancel from accepted/arrived. A `requested` ride keeps the
//     existing DECLINE as the owner's one exit (two owner verbs for one moment
//     would be two copies of one decision), and once the rider is aboard
//     (`enroute`) there is no owner cancel at all — ending early is what
//     "Dropped off" already is.
//
// Both paths stamp WHO cancelled into the same guarded UPDATE that decides
// whether the cancel wins (`cancelled_by`, first writer wins), and both
// publish through the one shared transition path — so the WS frame, the
// rider's push and the nav stand-down ride the same delivery every other
