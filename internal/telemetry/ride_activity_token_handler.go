// ErrLiveActivityClosed is returned by a registration seam when its anchor is
// past registration — for a RIDE, a terminal status or a reservation the
// sweeper gave up on; for a TRIP LEG (MYR-602), a leg that has ended. The cmd
// adapter translates store.ErrLiveActivityClosed into this sentinel so the
// handler layer stays decoupled from internal/store, exactly as
// ErrRideStatusConflict does.
//
// ANCHOR-NEUTRAL BY NAME, because both anchors return it and the HTTP answer is
// identical: 409, "end your Activity locally".

// Live Activity token registration (MYR-172, rest-api.md §7.21).
//
// The iOS app starts a Live Activity locally when a ride is accepted and is
// handed a per-Activity push token by ActivityKit. These two endpoints are how
// that token reaches the server, and how the app says the Activity is over.
//
// PASSENGER-ONLY, deliberately — the requester, and since MYR-540 every joined
// GROUP MEMBER. The owner is a party to the ride and can read it, but v1 starts
// no owner Activity, and an endpoint that accepted an owner's token would
// quietly create rows the sender would then push RIDER content to — including
// the destination label, which the owner has no business seeing on their lock
// screen. The owner variant is an explicit MYR-172 follow-up and will arrive
// with its own content-state.
//
// A MEMBER GETS THE RIDER-FLAVOURED CARD, and needs no new machinery to get it:
// registration is keyed (ride, user) per §7.21, so a member is simply another
// row on the same ride, and the ETA ticker — which fans out per REGISTRATION,
// not per rider — picks it up on its next pass. The content it renders is the
// ride's, and a member is riding in that ride, so there is nothing on the card
// they should not see.
//
// The token ROTATES. ActivityKit hands the app a replacement mid-ride and
// expects the server to switch to it, so registration is an UPSERT on
// (ride, party) rather than an insert, and a rotation is an ordinary
// re-registration. A client that re-registers after ending clears the
// tombstone, because it is telling us it has a live Activity again.

// maxActivityTokenLen bounds an accepted token. An ActivityKit push token is
// 64 hex characters today, the same shape as a device token, but the bound is
// deliberately generous for the same reason as maxDeviceTokenLen in
// internal/push: rejecting a valid future token would silently break Live
// Activities for everyone on that iOS release, which is far worse than storing
// a slightly odd string.
const maxActivityTokenLen = 256

// isHexToken reports whether every character of the token is a hex digit.
//
// The LENGTH bound above is generous on purpose — Apple could plausibly mint a
// longer token. The CHARSET is a different kind of bet: an APNs push token is
// the hex rendering of opaque binary and has been since the API existed, both
// halves of the platform (device tokens and ActivityKit tokens) agree on it,
// and a token containing anything else could not address a device even if we
// stored it. So this rejects a shape that is already broken rather than one
// that is merely unfamiliar.
//
// It is also a SECURITY control, and that is the reason it is here rather than
// on a wish-list. The token is interpolated into the APNs request path
// (push.Client.newRequest), and the P1 rule in data-classification.md §1.18 is
// that it is never logged in full. That file's belt-and-braces escaping and
// error-unwrapping make the rule hold for any input; refusing non-hex at the
// door means the pathological input never enters the system to begin with.
// Upper case is accepted: it is the same token, and rejecting a client that
// upper-cased its hex would be a bug report nobody could diagnose.

// Activity has already been ended for good, writing the error and reporting

// actually holds under a race.
//
// ONE ENDING IS FINAL AND ONE IS PROVISIONAL, and they look nothing alike from
// here.
//
// A TERMINAL STATUS is the obvious one, is visible in rec.Status, and is final.
//
// A RESERVATION EXPIRY is invisible in the status. The sweeper gives up on a
// late scheduled ride by recording dispatch_status='failed' with
// dispatch_error='reservation_expired' and LEAVING THE ROW AT `accepted` — and
// it latches dispatched_at, so no second expiry is possible. It ends and
// tombstones the Activities on the way past. A registration that only looked at
// the status would happily re-register (the upsert clears ended_at by design,
// which is right for a token rotation and wrong for this), the ETA ticker would
// pick the row back up, and the rider would watch a lock screen count down to a
// pickup that is never coming, with nothing left in the system able to end it a
// second time.
//
// That second case gets a sub-code precisely because the status does not
// explain it: a client seeing `conflict` on an `accepted` ride would have no
// way to tell a bug from a reservation that lapsed.
//
// BUT THE EXPIRY REFUSAL IS PROVISIONAL, AND SCOPED TO `accepted` (MYR-461).
// `reservation_expired` is a verdict on the DISPATCH — the car did not drive
// itself to the pickup inside the lateness ceiling — and this service promises
// twice over (rest-api.md §7.8 transition notes) that such a ride's parties
// "may still cancel or PROCEED MANUALLY". When they do, the ride advances to
// `arrived` and then `enroute`, and the verdict has been falsified by events:
// the car is demonstrably at the kerb with a passenger aboard. Refusing then
// was the defect — in external beta a rescued reservation ran on as a real,
// driven ride for 99 minutes while every registration answered 409, so the
// rider's lock screen went dark at the expiry and could never come back.
//
// The paragraph above still describes the ride this refusal is FOR: one that
// is still nothing but a reservation nobody came for. The ride's own status is
// the authority on whether a ride is over, and the terminal arm already
// enforces it.

	//
	// "THE ROWS ARE ALREADY TOMBSTONED" IS NO LONGER WHY, and the distinction

	// completed ride's rows stay LIVE for five minutes while its `end` is held,
	// so a POST arriving in that window meets a live row and is refused anyway
	// — by the status, which is the check that was always doing the work. The
	// refusal is if anything more necessary there: the upsert clears `ended_at`
	// and re-seeds the phase mark, so a registration allowed through mid-hold
