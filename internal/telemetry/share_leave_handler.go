// MYR-469 — DELETE /api/vehicles/{vehicleId}/share: the RIDER leaves a car
// somebody shared with them.
//
// The external-beta report was an absence: "I can't delete the lunar car as
// rider" — every removal path was owner-side (revoke, MYR-258's offboarding),
// and a rider's only ways out were asking the owner or deleting their whole
// account. This is the viewer-side mirror of ServeRevoke: the same tombstone,
// the same access teardown, keyed on the VEHICLE because a vehicle id is the
// only identity the rider holds (the §7.0 catalog rows carry no invite id).
//
// 204 with no body, IDEMPOTENT, and deliberately information-free: a vehicle
// the caller never had access to and one they already left are
// indistinguishable (both 204), so the endpoint cannot be used to probe which
// vehicle ids exist — ServeRevoke's own anti-enumeration stance, restated for
// a caller who is not the owner.
//
// THE ONE REFUSAL is 409 while the caller has a live ride on the car: the
// ride's telemetry access rides the grant, so a leave mid-ride would be the
// MYR-449 dark stream self-inflicted — a rider aboard a car their own app can
// no longer see. The guard is INSIDE the store's UPDATE (NOT EXISTS), so a
// ride created between a check and the write cannot slip through, and the 409
// is only ever spoken when an accepted grant genuinely exists to hold
// (an owner self-riding a never-shared car gets the ordinary 204 no-op).
