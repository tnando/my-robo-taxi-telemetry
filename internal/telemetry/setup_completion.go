// MYR-505 zero-touch setup completion: the sequence behind
// POST /api/tesla/vehicles/{vehicleId}/complete-setup (rest-api.md §7.23).
//
// THE ABSURDITY THIS DELETES. After MYR-489 the server can heal a car that was
// linked but never streamed, and after MYR-491 it can say so on the wire. What
// it could not do was START. The heal fires on a background pass (up to 45
// minutes) or on a signed command that APPLIED — which is why tester Amruth's
// live onboarding ended with someone telling him to tap Lock. A lock tap is not
// a setup step; it was a trigger wearing a control's clothes.
//
// The client knows the exact moment setup should complete: it handed the owner
// off to the Tesla app and gets `scenePhase` foreground back when they return.
// This is the server half of turning that moment into the trigger.
//
// THE SEQUENCE, AND WHY IT IS IN THIS ORDER.
//
//  1. STREAMING SHORT-CIRCUIT. If the car is already streaming, there is
//     nothing to complete. Answered from the row, with no Tesla call — which is
//     also what makes a second call after success cheap instead of another wake.
//  2. WAKE (unsigned, direct Fleet API). Before the pairing probe, because the
//     probe is fast and the wake is asynchronous — issuing it first buys the car
//     the whole probe budget to come up. It needs no virtual key, which is
//     essential: at this instant the key may not exist yet.
//  3. PROBE `fleet_status` (unsigned, direct Fleet API), bounded. Tesla's own
//     record of key enrollment. See the honesty note below.
//  4. ON PAIRED: reset the attempt schedule (opening a pairing epoch, so a
//     later reconciler pass is not buried under backoff earned before the key
//     existed) and run MYR-489's forced re-push through the signing proxy.
//
// THE HONESTY NOTE, which is the load-bearing design decision here. `not paired
// yet` and `asleep` are DIFFERENT ANSWERS and this endpoint never collapses one
// into the other. It can keep them apart because `fleet_status` is a Tesla-side
// record rather than a car query: a car that never wakes still yields a true
// answer about its pairing. So an expired wake never degrades into
// `awaiting_virtual_key` — a car whose key IS paired but which we could not
// reach reports `503 vehicle_asleep`, and a car Tesla says is unpaired reports
// `awaiting_virtual_key` whether or not it woke. Likewise, a probe we could not
// READ produces an ERROR, never a fabricated state: the one thing worse than no
// answer is a confident wrong one on a card whose whole job is naming the ONE
// thing left to do.
//
// THE READER/WRITER SPLIT IS PRESERVED. Wake and `fleet_status` are unsigned
// authenticated reads on the DIRECT Fleet API; the config push is the only
// call that goes through the tesla-http-proxy, and it goes there inside
// MYR-489's own code. Nothing in this file pushes config itself.
