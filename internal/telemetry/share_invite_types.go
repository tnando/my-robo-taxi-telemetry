// Two response objects exist and they are deliberately asymmetric:
//
//   - shareInviteWire is OWNER-FACING. It carries the owner-typed `label` and,
//     while pending, the live `code`. It is never returned to an invited party.
//   - redeemResponse is what the INVITED PARTY sees. It carries the owner's
//     first name and the granted vehicles, and nothing that would leak the
//     owner's label or a still-live code.
//
// Mixing them up is the single worst mistake available on this surface, which
// is why they live in separate types with no shared serializer.

// ShareInviteRow is the slim invite projection the handlers consume from their
// store dependency. Mirrors store.VehicleShare minus the server-only fields
// (accepted_by_user_id, revoked_at) the wire never carries — defined here so
// internal/telemetry stays decoupled from internal/store.
