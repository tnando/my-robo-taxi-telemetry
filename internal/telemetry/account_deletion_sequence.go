	// push-to-start tokens and their legs with them. Running the owned delete

	// roster would leave a token behind that could still start a Live Activity
	// on a device belonging to an account that no longer exists.
	//
	// THE FOURTH STATEMENT IS THE LEG-ANCHORED LIVE ACTIVITIES, and it is here
	// for the token's reason rather than the roster's: a go_live_activities row
	// anchored on go_trip_legs.trip_leg_id addresses ONE RUNNING CARD on this
	// person's phone, under somebody else's trip that is still happening. Left
	// behind, the leg detector updates it on the trip's next leg — the server

	//
	// WHAT SURVIVES, DELIBERATELY: the DRIVES that fell inside those windows. A
