// order, a second complete-setup call inside the same epoch finds the budget
// spent and pushes nothing — which is what makes the endpoint idempotent in the
// only sense that matters to a car.
//
// The row is RE-READ here rather than reused from the top of Complete: up to
// ProbeBudget has passed, and the reconciler's own pass may have escalated this
// very vehicle in the meantime. Re-reading is what stops the two paths from
// each spending the same epoch.

// recorded `forced_repush_at` against a NULL `signed_command_at`. Read back,
// that row says `epochForceSpent` = true (a force exists and does not predate a
// pairing epoch, because there is no pairing epoch), which is a latch: every
// later call answers `configuring` from a spend that may have accomplished
// nothing, and the reconciler's escalation is blocked on the same predicate.
