// The per-row wire SHAPES for GET /api/vehicles. Split out of
// vehicles_list_handler.go (300-line file cap) so the handler file holds the
// request flow and this one holds the shapes.
//
// The function that BUILDS these from a catalog row lives in
// vehicles_list_projection.go — a third file since MYR-507/MYR-515, when two
// more fields pushed the pair over the cap.

// vehicleSummary is the per-row catalog shape returned by the list
// endpoint. JSON tags mirror the wire schema in rest-api.md §7.0 and
// `VehicleSummary` in specs/rest.openapi.yaml. See also the mask
// allow-list in `internal/mask/tables.go` (vehicleSummaryOwnerFields).

	// that predates MYR-233, never "vehicle is free". Consumers treat an
	// absent value as "availability unknown → treat as available".
	HasActiveRide bool `json:"hasActiveRide"`
	// SharePermission is the compatibility projection of the caller's grant
	// over a SHARED vehicle (MYR-184, DERIVED as of MYR-369): `rides` when
	// the grant carries the ride capability, `live` otherwise. Never
	// `live_history` — that tier is retired. Emitted if and only if Role is
	// `viewer`; omitted on owner rows, where it would be meaningless — an
	// owner holds no grant. It is a UI-affordance hint: the server enforces
	// every gate it describes independently, so a client that ignores it
	// cannot escalate.
	SharePermission string `json:"sharePermission,omitempty"`
	// ServiceEstimatedEndAt is when this car's CURRENT SERVICE VISIT is
	// expected to end (MYR-316, contracts v0.17.0) — the same value and the
	// same semantics as VehicleState.serviceEstimatedEndAt. RFC 3339 UTC, or
	// null. Server-computed: Tesla's `service_etc` wins, else the owner-entered
	// §7.16 value, else null. Meaningful ONLY while `status` is `in_service`
	// and null otherwise. ALWAYS emitted (as an explicit null when there is no
	// estimate) so a consumer can tell "no estimate" from a pre-MYR-316 server.
	ServiceEstimatedEndAt *string `json:"serviceEstimatedEndAt"`
	// RideShareEnabled is the owner's ride-sharing switch (MYR-342,
	// contracts v0.20.0). OPTIONAL on the wire contract but ALWAYS emitted by
	// this server version (true or false), with NO omitempty — a `false` that
	// omitempty swallowed would read to a consumer as "absent", which the
	// contract defines as ENABLED, i.e. it would silently un-pause a paused car
	// on every catalog fetch. Absence therefore only ever signals a server
	// predating MYR-342, never a paused vehicle.
	RideShareEnabled bool `json:"rideShareEnabled"`
	// SetupState names the ONE thing still standing between this car and live
	// telemetry, or null when there is nothing to say (MYR-491,
	// contracts v0.24.0) — the SAME object and the SAME semantics as
	// VehicleState.setupState (§7.1), produced by the same derivation over the
	// same inputs.
	//
	// On the CATALOG for the rider-side picker (MYR-437): a car mid-setup must
	// read as "setting up", not be omitted and not be badged "offline", and the
	// picker cannot fetch a snapshot per row to learn which it is.
	//
	// A pointer with NO omitempty: the key is always present, and "nothing to
	// finish" is an explicit null.
	SetupState *SetupState `json:"setupState"`
	// TeslaAccessType is HOW THE PERSON WHO LINKED THIS CAR RELATES TO IT ON
	// TESLA'S SIDE — `"owner"` or `"driver"` (MYR-599, contracts v0.39.0).
	//
	// WHY IT IS ON THE WIRE AT ALL, given `setupState` already reports the
	// acknowledgment gate: the gate CLEARS. A driver who acknowledges gets a car
	// that streams and behaves exactly like an owner's, and the client still has
	// to say "you drive this car" on the picker row and in Settings — and still
	// has to know, on a later app launch, that this is a car whose owner could
	// revoke access at Tesla at any moment. `setupState` is about what is left
	// to finish; this is about what the car IS.
	//
	// OPTIONAL ON THE CONTRACT, ALWAYS EMITTED HERE, with NO omitempty: an
	// ABSENT value reads as `"owner"` (a server predating v0.39.0), so omitting
	// the string "owner" would be technically correct and would make the two
	// cases indistinguishable to anything reading the wire. Both roles: a viewer
	// meeting a car their friend drives rather than owns is the party most
	// helped by knowing it.
	//
	// REST-READ-TIME ONLY. A `vehicle_update` WS frame NEVER carries it, the
	// same delivery rule `setupState` follows and for a stronger reason: it is
	// not telemetry, no Tesla field feeds it, and it changes only when somebody
	// re-links a car. See internal/mask — the vehicle_update allow-lists do not
	// contain it, so there is nothing for VehicleStateMerger to fold.
	TeslaAccessType string `json:"teslaAccessType"`
	// TrimLabel is the display-ready trim of this car — "Plaid", "Performance",
	// "Long Range" (MYR-507, contracts v0.31.0). The SAME value and the SAME
	// column as VehicleState.trimLabel (§7.1, MYR-320): the snapshot does not
	// derive it, it reads it, so both surfaces read one column and there is no
	// second implementation to drift.
	//
	// On the CATALOG because the catalog is the ONLY vehicle-identity surface a
	// RIDER has. Owners get model/trim from the §7.1 snapshot; viewers never
	// fetch one, so a shared car could previously be named only by its colour
	// and a bare make — the "UltraRed" / "Tesla" the field report opened with.
	//
	// A pointer with NO omitempty: the key is always present, and "Tesla has not
	// told us the trim" is an explicit null — never `""`, which a descriptor
	// builder would happily render as an empty fragment between two separators.
	TrimLabel *string `json:"trimLabel"`
	// OwnerFirstName is the FIRST NAME of the person who owns this car
	// (MYR-581, contracts v0.37.0) — resolved by the platform's three-source
	// identity ladder ("User".name → the Apple first-consent name → go_users)
	// and reduced to its first token, the SAME resolution and the SAME
	// reduction behind `RideRequest.requesterName` and
	// `RedeemShareInviteResponse.ownerFirstName`.
	//
	// FIRST NAMES ONLY is the P1 policy for anything delivered to a
	// counterparty, and it is why this is not simply `"User".name`: a
	// counterparty gets "Amruth", never "Amruth Kelkar".
	//
	// On the CATALOG because the catalog is the only surface on which a RIDER
	// meets the person whose car they were granted. Without it the client had no
	// name to render and fell back to the make — which is how an incoming ride
	// card came to read "Tesla wants a ride" about a human being (MYR-532 item
	// 4). Emitted on BOTH roles: an owner's own row naming them is harmless and
	// keeps one projection for all three producers.
	//
	// A pointer with NO omitempty, the trimLabel convention: the key is always
	// present, and "this owner has no resolvable name" is an explicit null —
	// never `""`, which a possessive-descriptor builder would happily render as
	// "'s Model X".
	OwnerFirstName *string `json:"ownerFirstName"`
	// TelemetrySuspendedAt is WHEN OWNER-INACTIVITY SUSPENDED THIS VEHICLE'S
	// TELEMETRY STREAMING (MYR-592, contracts v0.38.0), or null while streaming
	// is configured normally.
	//
	// THE POLICY BEHIND IT: after five consecutive days without any
	// authenticated activity from the vehicle's OWNER, the platform removes the
	// car's fleet-telemetry configuration to stop the per-vehicle streaming
	// cost. Nothing else is touched — the OAuth grant, the virtual key, the
	// vehicle row and every share survive — which is what makes the §7.28
	// reconnect a single call.
	//
	// STRICTLY THE OWNER'S ACTIVITY (explicit client ruling): rider and viewer
	// usage does NOT defer suspension. So a viewer can meet a suspended car
	// whose owner has been away, and the honest rendering for them is the
	// ordinary no-live-telemetry state — never an error, never "broken".
	//
	// Emitted on BOTH roles. The owner is the one offered the two actions
	// (reconnect, unlink completely); the viewer is told so their UI can stop
	// waiting for frames that are not coming.
	//
	// THE INSTANT IS WHEN THE CONFIG WAS REMOVED — for copy ("disconnected 3
	// days ago"), never for a countdown. A pointer with NO omitempty, the
	// trimLabel convention: the key is always present and "streaming normally"
	// is an explicit null.
	TelemetrySuspendedAt *string `json:"telemetrySuspendedAt"`
	// Location is where this car was last known to be (MYR-515,
	// contracts v0.31.0) — the SAME coordinate pair the §7.1 snapshot and the
	// live `vehicle_update` frame carry, from the same encrypted columns.
	//
	// On the CATALOG because the rider picker needs a per-row pickup ETA and has
	// no other input for a row it is not watching: the client holds exactly ONE
	// coordinate (the watched car's, off the single-vehicle socket
	// subscription), and a viewer's per-row /snapshot is 403 by design
	// (MYR-432/449). Without this the picker can only rank the one car it
	// already opened.
	//
	// A NULLABLE OBJECT rather than two nullable scalars, deliberately: the GPS
	// pair is an ATOMIC GROUP (rest-api.md §5.4) and splitting one is its own
	// contract violation. Nesting makes "both or neither" structural instead of
	// conventional — there is no way to express the half-state that two flat
	// fields would permit.
	//
	// NULL means the server holds no fix, and it is the ONLY spelling of that on
	// this surface: the (0, 0) sentinel §7.1 uses is collapsed to null here by
	// newVehicleSummary. A picker must never measure an ETA to the Gulf of
	// Guinea.

//   - the pair is absent — never streamed, or a repo with no encryptor, or a
//     half-pair the store already refused to surface;
//   - the pair is present and is EXACTLY (0, 0) — the no-fix sentinel that
//     vehicle-state-schema.md §2.3 defines for the NOT NULL snapshot columns,
//     where the schema cannot express absence and 0,0 stands in for it.
//
// The second is the one that would actually lie. §7.0 CAN express absence, so
// it does, and the sentinel never reaches a consumer that would have to know to
// re-interpret it. A picker fed 0,0 does not fail — it confidently renders a
// pickup ETA to a point in the Atlantic.
//
// The test is EXACT equality on both axes, not a tolerance: a real fix that
// rounds to within metres of Null Island is not a thing the sentinel needs to
// protect against, and widening the test would start discarding genuine
