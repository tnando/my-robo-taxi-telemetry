// The HOT SCHEDULE for a fresh key-pairing epoch (MYR-529).
//
// THE CLIENT DIRECTIVE, verbatim: "You should run the reconciler once a car
// virtual key is paired why do people have to wait."
//
// WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, from Joey Verrone's row rather than from theory.
// His car linked at 01:22:08Z (MYR-517's seed wrote the schedule row), the
// virtual key was proven paired at 01:23:10.59Z (`signed_command_at`), and
// MYR-489's in-band signal did exactly what it was built to do 337 ms later: it
// reset the backoff and reconciled the car ON THE SPOT. Tesla answered `synced`.
// And then the three gates that ration the forced re-push declined it — for the
// best of reasons, since that was the FIRST synced-but-quiet observation and a
// car one second past pairing deserves a cycle to connect on its own — and
// parked the row at `next_attempt_at` +15 MINUTES with `forced_repush_at` NULL.
// Joey drove with no telemetry. Nothing was broken; the cadence was simply
// written for a fleet in its steady state and applied to a car in the one
// minute of its life when a human was watching.
//
// So the fix is not a new trigger — MYR-489/505/517 already put a trigger on
// every door. It is that the SCHEDULE a trigger writes must be measured in
// minutes while the pairing evidence is fresh:
//
//	epoch  →  +1 min  →  +3 min  →  +8 min  →  ordinary 15m/30m/1h backoff
//
// and the forced delete-and-recreate — the maneuver that actually brings a
// stuck car up — must be spent INSIDE that window rather than after it.
//
// THREE PROPERTIES KEEP THIS FROM BECOMING A TESLA-TRAFFIC MULTIPLIER.
//
//  1. The ladder is bounded and per-epoch. Three extra examinations, then the
//     MYR-448 curve resumes exactly as before. An epoch is opened only by proof
//     of pairing and only once per debounce window.
//  2. The cheapest check runs first. A car that came up on its own is detected
//     from the LISTING ROW — `status` plus `lastUpdated`, both already selected
//     — and costs ZERO Tesla calls. That is what makes it safe to look at a
//     freshly paired car every minute: the healthy majority are free.
//  3. The escalation budget is untouched. Still one forced re-push per pairing
//     epoch, still `epochForceSpent`, still shared verbatim with §7.23. The hot
//     window changes WHEN it is spent, never HOW MANY times.

// under it.

//
// It is deliberately NOT the same number as Interval, and separating them is
// the third part of the MYR-529 fix. Interval is the BACKOFF BASE — the gap a
// single unlucky car waits between attempts — and 15 minutes is right for that.
// It was also, accidentally, the loop's tick, which meant a row whose
// `next_attempt_at` had just passed could sit unexamined for another full
// interval: Joey's 01:38 row was still untouched at 01:40+, and the hot ladder
// below would have been meaningless against it. A due row is now picked up

// returned: a `status` that only a streamed frame can have written (MYR-454)
// plus a `lastUpdated` inside the quiet horizon. Answering from that costs
// nothing upstream, which is the entire reason the hot ladder above is
// affordable — most freshly paired cars connect by themselves within a minute
// or two, and every one of them exits here for free with its remaining hot
// passes cancelled.
//
// Clearing the schedule rather than rescheduling it, for the same reason a

//
// Inside a hot epoch the ladder wins for its first few attempts and then DECAYS
// into the ordinary curve rather than jumping to it: the attempt count handed to
// backoffForOutcome has the ladder's length subtracted, so the pass after the
// ladder waits one plain Interval, the next two, and so on — the same sequence a
// car that had never been hot would have seen.
// ownerAccessRetryGap is how long a vehicle waits after Tesla's standing

//
// A FLAT DAY, AND DELIBERATELY NOT A LADDER. Every other outcome in this
// reconciler is retried on a doubling backoff because every other outcome
// describes something that might have changed since: a car asleep, a key not yet
// paired, a transient upstream error. `owner_access_required` describes an
// answer that CANNOT change until either Tesla ships DRIVER-token config
// creation — announced as "coming soon" in March 2024 and still unshipped as of
// 2026-09-05 — or the car's real owner adds it under their own account. Neither
// happens on a schedule this process can predict.
//
// So the doubling ladder buys nothing and costs something: it would climb to
// MaxBackoff over a handful of passes, which is the same practical answer with
// extra Tesla traffic on the way there, and it would make the interval depend on
// an attempt count that says nothing about the condition. A flat day is the
// honest reading — check again tomorrow, in case the world changed — and it is
// short enough that a car un-blocked by either route starts streaming the next
// day without an operator.
//
// It deliberately IGNORES the hot pairing ladder. A hot epoch means "somebody
// just proved the virtual key is paired, so try hard"; pairing is not what is
// wrong here, and hammering a refusal because a person tapped unlock would be
// the wrong response to the right signal.
