// The per-row PROJECTION for GET /api/vehicles: the one function that turns a
// VehicleCatalogRow into the wire shape, plus its VIN helper.
//
// Third file in the §7.0 trio, split out under the CLAUDE.md 300-line cap when
// MYR-507/MYR-515 added two fields: vehicles_list_handler.go holds the request
// flow, vehicles_list_types.go holds the shapes, and this holds the mapping
// between them. Keeping the builder on its own means the next field added to
// the catalog lands in a file with room for the argument that justifies it —
// which, on this surface, has been most of the diff every time.
//
// Shared by all three §7.0 producers (the owner list, the viewer merge, and the
// redeem response), so they cannot emit different rows for the same vehicle.

// Shared by the owner list, the viewer merge (vehicles_list_viewer.go), and the
// redeem response, so all three emit byte-identical rows for the same vehicle.
//
// now is the instant the MYR-491 setup derivation is judged against, passed in
// rather than read here for the same two reasons as on the snapshot: one
// response is one instant, and the rules are testable without waiting.

		// mask role split into three, a ride member's row started emitting
		// `role: "viewer"` with the tier MISSING. A consumer told to read an
		// absent tier as the lowest one would have been guessing about a car it
		// was sitting in. Owners are excluded for the original reason: an owner

// wireRole projects an internal auth.Role onto the two-value enum

//
// THERE ARE FOUR INTERNAL ROLES AND TWO WIRE VALUES, and this function is the
// only place the gap is crossed. MYR-602 introduced `ride_member` and
// `trip_participant` as MASK roles — they decide which FIELDS a caller
// receives — and deliberately did not widen the wire enum:
//
//   - vehicle-summary.schema.json declares `role` as a CLOSED enum. A client
//     decoding it into a Swift enum or a TypeScript union rejects an
//     unrecognised member, so emitting "trip_participant" would not degrade
//     gracefully — it would fail the whole row on every shipped build.
//   - The client does not need it. The distinction the app actually renders is
//     "is there a trip open on this car right now", and that is `activeTripId`
//     — a value, not a role — which is exactly why the contract added it as a
//     separate field rather than as a third role.
//   - An RBAC role is an internal name. Publishing it would make every future
//     narrowing or split a breaking wire change.
//
// TOTAL BY CONSTRUCTION: anything that is not RoleOwner is a non-owner, so a
// role added later without touching this function is reported as `viewer` —
// the narrower, safer answer. TestWireRoleNeverEmitsAnInternalRoleName pins
// that no auth.Role maps to its own name.
