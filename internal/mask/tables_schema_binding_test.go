// Schema-bound tripwires for the vehicle_state role tables (MYR-435,
// adversarial-review follow-up).
//
// TestVehicleStateRoleListsPartitionOwnerFields proves the two role lists
// partition the OWNER LIST — but the owner list is itself hand-maintained, so
// that check is self-referential at the edge: a field added to
// vehicle-state.schema.json and to the response struct, but forgotten in
// tables.go, is invisible to it. It would simply never reach any role, which is
// fail-closed and safe, but silent — and "silent" is the property the MYR-427
// audit was written about.
//
// These tests close that edge by binding the tables to the SCHEMA, so a new
// wire field cannot ship unclassified. Same idiom as the MYR-298 mirror
// tripwires: the assertion exists to land the diff in front of a reviewer with
// the reasoning written directly above it.

// wireOnlyOwnerFields are owner-list entries that are deliberately NOT
// properties of vehicle-state.schema.json. Each needs a reason, because the
// default expectation is that a masked wire field is a schema field.
//
// Listing them explicitly is what lets the tripwire below be strict: anything
// in the owner list that is neither a schema property nor named here is a typo
// or an undocumented wire name, and fails.

// vehicle-state-schema.md §2.4 requires the members of an `x-atomic-group` to
// be emitted together — a consumer that receives `status` without its companion
// `gearPosition` cannot render either honestly. A ROLE MASK can break that
// invariant just as easily as a broadcast bug can, by allowing some members and
// denying others, and the narrowing in MYR-435 came close: `gearPosition` was
// kept specifically because splitting the `gear` group would have been its own
// contract violation.
//
// That reasoning was prose in a comment. This asserts it against the schema, so
// a future narrowing cannot split a group by inspection failure. Today: the nav
// / gear / gps / charge groups are entirely viewer-visible, and no declared
// group is entirely owner-only — but the test states the invariant, not today's
