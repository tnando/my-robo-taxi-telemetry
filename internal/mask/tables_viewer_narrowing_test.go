// MYR-435 — the client's viewer-mask narrowing, pinned at the table.
//
// Client decision (2026-08-02): "Remove media/cabin and any vehicle controls."
//
// These tests assert on RAW JSON KEYS rather than on the mask sets or on a Go
// struct, and that choice is load-bearing. The contract a viewer's client
// actually depends on is "the key is not in the bytes" (rest-api.md §5.1,
// absent-not-nulled). A struct-level assertion would pass just as happily
// against a field serialized as `"interiorTemp": null`, which still tells the
// viewer the field exists and, for booleans and zero-able numerics, still leaks
// a value-shaped default into their decoder.

// removedFromViewers is every field MYR-435 took away, grouped the way the
// client described them. Kept as one list so each test iterates the same set —
// a field added to the owner-only list must be added here too, which
// TestRemovedSetMatchesOwnerOnlyList enforces.

// and asserting on raw JSON keys, so a future "just for the REST path" branch
