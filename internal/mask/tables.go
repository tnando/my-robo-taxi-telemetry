	// MYR-435 (client decision, 2026-08-02): the viewer arm is NO LONGER
	// "owner minus vin". It is an explicit allow-list — location, route,
	// identity, charge, availability, freshness — with media, cabin
	// climate, and all vehicle-controls state withheld. All THREE delivery
	// surfaces read THIS table, so the narrowing applies to each by
	// construction. That is pinned per-surface, by tests that drive the
	// actual delivery path and iterate OwnerOnlyVehicleStateFields():
	//
	//   REST snapshot ......... internal/telemetry,

	//   WS live broadcast ..... internal/ws,
	//     TestBroadcaster_CabinOnlyTelemetry_SendsViewerNothing
	//   WS connect-time replay  internal/ws,
	//     TestHub_SendSnapshot_ViewerReplayOmitsEveryOwnerOnlyField
	//
	// MYR-286: `licensePlate` is in BOTH role allow-lists. That is a
	// DELIBERATE PRODUCT DECISION, not an oversight, and it reverses
	// the forward-looking owner-only placeholder this table carried
	// before the field was ever on the wire: the entire purpose of the
	// owner-entered plate is that a RIDER can identify the correct car
	// at pickup, which fails if only the owner can see it. Contrast
	// `vin` (MYR-279), which stays owner-only — a VIN identifies the
	// physical car and links to its location history, while a plate is
	// the label the rider is standing on the curb reading. Both are
	// P1; the asymmetry is about who needs the value, not about tier.
	// MYR-602 (CLIENT DECISION, 2026-09-05) SPLIT THE NON-OWNER ARM IN TWO and
	// NARROWED the plain-viewer half. Thomas's ruling: "you should really only
	// see live location during an active trip shared with a user" (or an
	// accepted active ride).
	//
	// This SUPERSEDES MYR-435's reasoning for keeping the navigation group on
	// `viewer` ("where is this car taking me is the other half of the
	// shared-viewing feature"). That argument was about a party who is watching
	// a journey; the client's position is that a STANDING share is not that
	// party — it is durable and remote, and most of the time the grantee is at
	// home while the owner drives alone. Being on a ride, or inside a trip
	// window the owner opened, IS that party.
	//
	// So there are now three non-owner arms and only two field lists:
	//
	//   viewer           — the catalog/availability fields. NO location group,
	//                      NO navigation group. What is left answers "which car
	//                      is this, can it make a trip, is it available".
	//   ride_member      — vehicleStateLiveViewerFields, which is EXACTLY the
	//   trip_participant   pre-MYR-602 viewer set. Ride tracking is unchanged
	//                      by construction: same list, same bytes.
	//
	// The two elevated roles SHARE ONE LIST deliberately. Both mean "this
	// person is party to where the car is going right now", and one list is
	// what stops the two drifting into a distinction nobody intended. They stay
	// separate ROLES because they carry different provenance, which is what
	// decides drive access (§7.2–§7.4).

	// rest-api.md §5.2.0 — Vehicles list (vehicle summary). Owners and
	// viewers see the same field set; the viewer list adds
	// `sharePermission` and subtracts NOTHING. `licensePlate` (MYR-286)
	// is in both lists for the same deliberate reason as the snapshot
	// resource above — a rider identifies the car at pickup from the
	// catalog row.
	//
	// MYR-184 REMOVED the previous `name` subtraction. Two reasons, and
	// the second is the binding one:
	//
	//   - Product: the rider UI renders "{Owner}'s {Vehicle}", so the
	//     nickname is the label a viewer reads. Vehicle nicknames are
	//     P1-acceptable for viewers under the same policy that puts
	//     first names in the push payloads.
	//   - Contract: `name` is in the `required` list of
	//     schemas/vehicle-summary.schema.json. Stripping it made EVERY
	//     viewer row — the §7.0 merge and the §7.5.5 redeem response
	//     alike — fail its own schema. A field this mask removes must
	//     be OPTIONAL in the schema; that is asserted directly by
	//     TestViewerMaskKeepsEverySchemaRequiredField in
	//     internal/telemetry.
	//
	// The viewer merge is live (MYR-184), so this projection runs on
	// every list call from anyone who has redeemed an invite.
	// MYR-602: `location` — the catalog row's last-known coordinate (MYR-515) —
	// leaves the plain-viewer arm for the same reason the snapshot's GPS group
	// does. The two MUST move together: MYR-515's own justification for putting
	// a coordinate on the catalog was that "the viewer already receives
	// latitude/longitude at FULL PRECISION on the streaming path, for exactly
	// these vehicles", and that premise is what MYR-602 retracted. Leaving it
	// here would make the catalog the weaker surface setting the real privacy
	// bound — the exact failure MYR-515 warned about under ON COARSENING.
	//
	// CONSEQUENCE, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED: the rider client derives its
	// "N min away" pickup ETA by routing from this coordinate
	// (RoadPickupETAStore, MYR-577). A plain viewer therefore has no input for
	// it and the client renders no estimate. THE SERVER DOES NOT FABRICATE ONE
	// — there is no server-side route solver, and inventing a number here to
	// fill the hole would be worse than the honest absence.

	// the same tier as its identity siblings `model`, `year` and `color`, which
	// have been in both allow-lists since v1. All four are legible through a
	// windshield from the kerb — the badge on the boot lid IS the trim — so
	// there is nothing here for masking to protect, and this entry classifies it
	// alongside its siblings rather than reasoning about it afresh. That is the
	// same argument `internal/mask/tables_details_test.go` already makes for the
	// SAME FIELD on the /snapshot resource, where it likewise goes to BOTH roles.
	//
	// The viewer is in fact the party this field is FOR: an owner can read the
	// trim off their own /snapshot, but a rider never fetches one, so the
	// catalog row is the only place a shared car can say what it is. Withholding
	// it is what left "UltraRed" standing in for a whole vehicle descriptor.
	//
	// `trim` — the RAW BADGE CODE ("p74d") — is deliberately NOT here, and is not
	// on the catalog at all: it is not display-safe for either role.
	"trimLabel",
	// MYR-515 — the car's last known position, and the FIRST P1 field on this
	// resource. Every other entry above is P0 except `licensePlate`, so this one
	// carries the heaviest justification on the list.
	//
	// WHY IT IS IN BOTH ROLE ALLOW-LISTS. The viewer already receives
	// `latitude`/`longitude` at FULL PRECISION on the streaming path, for
	// exactly these vehicles: `vehicleStateViewerFields` retains the whole
	// Speed/GPS atomic group, annotated there as "the entire point of a shared
	// live map", and MYR-435's narrowing deliberately left it. So a coordinate
	// on a catalog row is not a new disclosure — it is the same value, over a
	// different transport, to a party already entitled to it.
	//
	// The honest caveat, stated rather than glossed: the catalog does hand a
	// viewer N positions at once, where the socket hands out one per
	// subscription. That is an AGGREGATION difference, not an entitlement one —
	// the grant is per-vehicle and a viewer could subscribe to each car in turn
	// for the same data — so what this changes is convenience, not reach. The
	// row still only exists because a live accepted grant produced it: the
	// shared-catalog query's join IS the access check, and a suspended or
	// revoked grant yields no row and therefore no coordinate.
	//
	// ON COARSENING. Considered and deliberately NOT applied. The repo has no
	// precision convention to follow, and inventing one here would be theatre:
	// the same viewer can read the exact position off the socket a moment later,
	// so rounding the catalog protects nothing while measurably degrading the
	// feature it exists for — a pickup ETA over a short hop is exactly where a
	// coarsened coordinate is worst. If a future policy DOES coarsen shared
	// positions, it must coarsen the stream and this row together; splitting
	// them would leave the weaker surface setting the real privacy bound.
	//
	// P1 handling still binds in full: never logged (data-classification.md
	// §2.2), never emitted outside the vehicle's party, encrypted at rest, and
	// NOT on any WebSocket delta for this resource. And the wire value is
	// null-when-absent rather than the (0,0) sentinel — a sentinel a consumer
	// forgot to re-interpret is a coordinate leak of a different kind.
	"location",
	// MYR-581 — the owner's FIRST NAME, and the SECOND P1 field on this
	// resource after `location` (third counting `licensePlate`).
	//
	// WHY IT IS IN BOTH ROLE ALLOW-LISTS. The viewer is the party this field
	// exists for, and the disclosure is one the platform has already made to
	// exactly this party on other surfaces: `RedeemShareInviteResponse.
	// ownerFirstName` hands the redeeming viewer this same owner's first name at
	// the moment they join, the signed share link carries it as `from`, and the
	// push payloads carry a first name in both directions. A viewer holding a
	// live accepted grant on a car has already been told whose car it is; the
	// catalog row is where they can still see it a week later. Withholding it is
	// what left an incoming ride card reading "Tesla wants a ride" about a
	// person (MYR-532 item 4).
	//
	// The owner's own row naming the owner is a non-disclosure — they are the
	// subject — so it stays in the base list rather than becoming a viewer-only
	// entry; that also keeps one projection for all three §7.0 producers.
	//
	// FIRST NAMES ONLY, enforced upstream in the store's first-token reduction
	// rather than here. That is the platform's P1 counterparty policy, and it is
	// the reason this entry is not a full-name field: a mask cannot shorten a
	// value, only drop it, so the narrowing has to happen before the map is
	// built. What reaches this allow-list is already "Amruth", never "Amruth
	// Kelkar".
	//
	// P1 handling binds in full: NEVER logged (data-classification.md §2.2),
	// never emitted outside the vehicle's party (the shared-catalog query's join
	// IS the access check, so a suspended or revoked grant yields no row and
	// therefore no name), and NOT on any WebSocket delta for this resource.
	// `null` — the owner has no resolvable name — is the ordinary state for an
	// Apple-native account that was never asked, and is deliberately not the
	// empty string.
	"ownerFirstName",
	// MYR-592 — the owner-inactivity suspension instant (contracts v0.38.0).
	//
	// P0, like its neighbour `status`: an operational fact about a platform
	// action on a car, correlating to no person. The BEHAVIOURAL signal it is
	// derived from — the owner's last-seen instant in go_user_activity — is P1
	// and never leaves the server. What crosses the wire is only the
	// consequence, and only for a car the caller is already party to.
	//
	// IN BOTH ROLE ALLOW-LISTS, and the viewer's case is the one that had to be
	// argued. A viewer is told about a suspension they did not cause and cannot
	// undo — which sounds like a disclosure until you consider the alternative:
	// an un-told viewer renders a permanent spinner over a car that will never
	// stream again, or worse, an error. The contract forbids exactly that
	// ("Consumers MUST NOT render a suspended vehicle as broken, in-service, or
	// offline-forever"), and a client can only obey a rule it has the input for.
	// The suspension is also inferable from the silence alone, so withholding it
	// buys no privacy and costs the honest rendering.
	//
	// The ACTIONS are what differ by role, not the field: only the owner is
	// offered §7.28 reconnect and §7.12 unlink. That asymmetry lives in the
	// client, and on the server in those two endpoints' owner-only gates.
	//
	// NOT on any WebSocket delta for this resource — a suspended vehicle emits
	// no frames at all, which is the whole point.
	"telemetrySuspendedAt",

	// MYR-602 — the id of the trip whose window is OPEN on this car right now
	// FOR THIS CALLER, or absent when there is none.
	//
	// ON EVERY ROLE, and that is the point rather than a convenience. It is how
	// a NON-OWNER client knows it may watch the car: MYR-602's rule is that a
	// non-owner sees live location only during an active ride or an active
	// trip, and the wire `role` enum stays the closed two-value one, so the
	// server's resolution to `trip_participant` is invisible on the wire and
	// this field is the only thing that reports it. Withholding it from the
	// party it exists for would leave a client with the location group in hand
	// and no way to know why.
	//
	// P0. An opaque cuid naming a relationship the caller is already party to
	// — the same classification as `role` and `sharePermission`, and the same
	// as `hasActiveRide`, which reports the equivalent fact for the other
	// window-scoped role. It names no place, no person and no time.
	//
	// THE VALUE IS ALREADY CALLER-SCOPED before it reaches this list: the
	// statement that resolves it requires the caller to be the owner or a live
	// participant with a live share, so there is no trip id here that the
	// caller does not already have access to.
	//
	// ABSENT rather than null when there is no open window. The contract marks
	// it optional, and absence is what a pre-v0.41.0 server produces too — so a
	// client that must handle absence anyway handles both.

// vehicleSummaryViewerFields is the owner list PLUS `sharePermission`, with
// NOTHING subtracted (rest-api.md §5.2.0).
//
// `name` used to be subtracted here. It is not any more: the rider UI renders
// the shared car as "{Owner}'s {Vehicle}", so the owner-curated nickname is the
// label the viewer reads, and a vehicle nickname is P1-acceptable for viewers
// under the same policy that puts the owner's first name in the push payloads
// and in RedeemShareInviteResponse.ownerFirstName. It was also a CONTRACT
// violation: `name` is `required` in schemas/vehicle-summary.schema.json, so
// stripping it made every viewer row invalid against the shape its own consumer
// decodes. Anything removed here in future MUST be optional in that schema.
//
// MYR-184 added `sharePermission`, and it is the first field that is
// VIEWER-ONLY rather than owner-only — the asymmetry runs the other way for
// once. It describes the access the caller holds over a car they do NOT own, so
// it is meaningless on an owner row (an owner holds no grant) and is
// deliberately absent from the owner list above rather than being emitted
// empty. P0: an authorization value describing a relationship, not identifying
// data — the same classification as its sibling `role`.
//
// MYR-369 made it DERIVED from the grant's flags rather than a stored tier, and

// projects one, and there is no "suspended" field here to add.

//     row is never serialized at all, so a field describing when it happened
//     has no wire moment to appear in. Keeping it would imply revoked rows
//     are returned.
