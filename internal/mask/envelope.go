package mask

// Envelope fields and the substantive-payload predicate (MYR-435).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. websocket-protocol.md §4.6 requires the hub to suppress a
// frame whose mask projection left nothing — "sending an empty broadcast would
// leak 'something happened on this vehicle' to a viewer who shouldn't even know
// the field existed." That rule was implemented as `len(projected) == 0`, and
// that implementation had a hole the MYR-435 narrowing turned into a live leak.
//
// The broadcast path injects `lastUpdated` into EVERY non-nav frame before
// masking (internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go), and `lastUpdated` is viewer-visible —
// a viewer must be able to tell live from stale. So a frame carrying ONLY
// owner-only deltas does not project to zero fields for a viewer. It projects
// to exactly one: {"lastUpdated": …}. `len(projected) == 0` is false, the
// suppression gate never fires, and the frame goes out.
//
// The values are gone, but the FRAME is the signal. A `mediaNowPlayingElapsedMs`
// tick alone becomes a beacon that pulses only while audio is playing — which is
// verbatim the "someone is listening right now" occupancy signal that
// vehicleStateOwnerOnlyFields removes the media block to prevent. Door, lock and
// climate deltas are the same tell: a pulse each time someone opens the trunk.
// Masking the values while forwarding the timing defeats the point of masking.
//
// So the predicate is not "is the projection non-empty" but "does the projection
// carry anything that is actually ABOUT THE CAR". A frame whose surviving
// content is purely descriptive of the frame itself says nothing the recipient
// is entitled to learn, and must not be sent.

// envelopeFields are wire keys that describe the FRAME rather than the vehicle.
// They ride along on payloads as metadata, they are visible to every role, and
// on their own they carry no vehicle state at all.
//
// Kept here, beside the role tables, deliberately: the ws package is where these
// keys are injected, but if the set lived there it would drift out of step with
// the allow-lists that decide what counts as substantive. A key added here is
// one more thing that cannot, by itself, keep a frame alive.
//
// A key belongs in this set only if BOTH hold:
//
//  1. it is in the viewer allow-list (otherwise masking already removes it), and
//  2. its value is a property of the delivery, not an observation of the car.
//
// `lastUpdated` qualifies: it is the wire freshness marker. Nothing else does
// today — `status` and `chargeLevel` describe the car, `vehicleId` identifies
// it, and all three are legitimate one-field frames.
var envelopeFields = map[string]struct{}{
	"lastUpdated": {},
}

// IsSubstantive reports whether a projected payload carries at least one field
// that is an observation of the vehicle, rather than consisting solely of
// envelope/freshness keys.
//
// This is the suppression predicate callers should use in place of a bare
// `len(projected) == 0`. It is strictly stronger: an empty map is not
// substantive, so every case the old check caught is still caught.
//
// CALLERS MUST PASS THE OUTPUT OF A PROJECTION — the map returned by
// Apply(payload, For(resource, role)) — NOT the raw pre-mask payload. Run on
// the input, the predicate answers a different and useless question: an
// owner-only field like `interiorTemp` is not an envelope key, so a cabin-only
// payload would report itself substantive and the frame would ship. The whole
// point is that the fields deciding the answer are the ones that SURVIVED
// masking for this specific role.
//
// Applied to ALL roles, not just viewers, and that is intentional — a frame
// carrying only "the timestamp changed" informs nobody, whatever their role.
// It cannot regress owners in practice because the broadcast path returns early
// when there are no real fields to send (nav_broadcast.go checks
// `len(fields) == 0` BEFORE adding lastUpdated), so an owner-bound payload of
// nothing-but-freshness is not a shape production emits. Role-independence is
// what keeps this honest: a predicate that suppressed only for viewers would be
// a second, quieter mask table.

// IsSubstantiveExcludingSentinels is IsSubstantive for the LIVE BROADCAST path,

// WHY THE TWO SURFACES NEED DIFFERENT PREDICATES (MYR-602). Apply substitutes
// the schema-required location fields in place (sentinels.go), so a viewer's
// projection of a GPS-only delta is not empty — it is {speed:0, latitude:0,
// longitude:0}, three constants. On the connect-time SNAPSHOT that is exactly
// right and IsSubstantive is the predicate to use: the snapshot is the client's
// one delivery of the whole known state, it is triggered by the subscriber
// rather than by the car, and suppressing it would leave the assembled
// VehicleState missing six required keys for the life of the connection.
//
// ON A LIVE DELTA IT IS EXACTLY WRONG. The values say nothing, but the frame's
// ARRIVAL says the car is streaming right now — the same timing leak
// IsSubstantive exists to close (MYR-435), rebuilt out of zeros. So the live
// path judges substantiveness on what the mask let THROUGH, and the sentinels
// ride the frames that were going out anyway.
//
// fieldsMasked is Apply's second return value. A key that is in it AND present
// in the projection is a substitution by construction: Apply reports every
// withheld field there, and the only withheld fields that leave a key behind
// are the sentinels.
