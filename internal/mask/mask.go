// Package mask implements the role-based field projection layer that
// governs every SDK-exposed REST response and WebSocket frame. The
// canonical per-resource matrix lives in docs/contracts/rest-api.md §5.2
// and is consumed by both the WebSocket hub's per-role projection
// (docs/contracts/websocket-protocol.md §4.6) and the REST handler-layer
// mask (rest-api.md §5.1). The single source-of-truth for the matrix
// satisfies CG-DC-5 in docs/contracts/data-classification.md §5.
//
// Allow-list semantics are fail-closed:
//   - A field that is not enumerated in the role's mask is OMITTED from
//     the projected output entirely (the JSON key is absent, not nulled).
//     "Absent, not nulled" is required by rest-api.md §5.1; emitting null
//     would leak the existence of the field to the viewer.
//   - An unknown (resource, role) pair returns the zero-value mask, which
//     in turn produces an empty projected output — i.e., deny-all.
//   - The empty Role("") sentinel from auth.ParseRole models "unknown
//     role" and also resolves to deny-all.
//
// Payload values flow through this package as map[string]any. The "any"
// element type is intentional — the mask is schema-less and projects
// arbitrary JSON-decoded payloads (vehicle_update fields, REST response
// bodies). Constraining the value type would force every caller to
// flatten its struct into a typed map, which is more work for no
// safety win at the projection step.
