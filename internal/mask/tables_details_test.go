// TestMYR320DetailFieldsAreBothRoles pins the MYR-320 mask decision at its
// enforcement point, so a later "tighten the viewer mask" change has to argue
// with it explicitly rather than sliding through.
//
// trimLabel and fsdVersion go to BOTH roles because they MATCH THEIR DIRECT
// SIBLINGS, which is how the choice was made rather than reasoning about them
// afresh: trimLabel is an equipment fact of the same tier as trim/model/year,
// fsdVersion a software designation of the same tier as softwareVersion — and
// all four of those are viewer-visible.
//
// MYR-435 narrowed the viewer arm hard (media, cabin, and all controls state
// are gone) but deliberately did NOT touch these four: they describe the CAR's
// equipment and software, which is neither media, cabin, nor a control tile.
// Note the contrast with seatCoolingCapable, which IS an equipment fact and was
// still removed — because its only consumer was a control tile viewers no
// longer render. Equipment-ness alone is not the test; having a viewer-facing
// consumer is.
//
// The `vin` assertion is in the same test on purpose. It is the ONE owner-only
// snapshot field, precisely because it links to the physical car and its
// location history (data-classification.md §1.3, §2.1), and none of these four
// does. Losing that contrast is how a field ends up owner-only by analogy
// instead of by argument.

// TestMYR320DetailFieldsSplitOnTheVehiclesList pins the other half of the
// contract, which MYR-507 SPLIT.
//
// This test used to assert that BOTH trimLabel and fsdVersion were detail-sheet
// only, on the reasoning that "nobody renders a trim label in a catalog row" and
// that widening the most-expensive-per-byte response was not worth it. The first
// clause turned out to be false, and in the one place it mattered most: a VIEWER
// never fetches a /snapshot at all, so for a rider the catalog row is the ONLY
// surface on which a car can say what it is. With the trim withheld, a shared
// car's descriptor degraded to the raw colour token — a lock-screen Live
// Activity that read "UltraRed", and a review sheet whose model slot rendered
// the bare make "Tesla".
//
// So `trimLabel` is now on the catalog, in BOTH role allow-lists, classified
// with the identity siblings `model` / `year` / `color` it belongs to. The
// byte-cost argument survives intact and is simply outweighed: one short text
// column against a rider being unable to identify the car pulling up.
//
// `fsdVersion` STAYS OFF, and the split is the point of this test. It is a
// software designation, not an identity fact; no catalog row renders it, no
// descriptor ladder degrades without it, and nothing about MYR-507 argues for
// it. Keeping the assertion here means a later "well, we added trimLabel"
// cannot carry fsdVersion along by analogy.

// TestVehicleStateRoleListsPartitionOwnerFields is the anti-rot invariant that

// arm an explicit allow-list.
//
// The MYR-427 audit's finding was that a SUBTRACTION mask rots: every field
// added to the owner list reaches viewers by default, decided by whoever did
// not think about it. An explicit allow-list fixes that but introduces the
// opposite failure — a field added to the owner list and to NEITHER role list
// is simply invisible to viewers, silently, which is safe but undocumented.
//
// So the two lists must PARTITION the owner list exactly:
//
//	set(owner) == set(viewer) ⊎ set(ownerOnly)

// Adding a field to vehicleStateOwnerFields now fails this test until it is
// placed in one list or the other. That failure IS the classification
