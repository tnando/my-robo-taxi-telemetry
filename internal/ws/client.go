	// window edge changes what a caller may see (MYR-602).
	//
	// Per websocket-protocol.md §4.6 the hub looks the role up here to pick
	// the role-appropriate pre-marshaled frame to enqueue. A missing entry
	// resolves to the empty Role("") sentinel and the hub treats it as
	// deny-all (fail-closed).
	//
	// WHY AN ATOMIC SWAP AND NOT A MUTEX. This is read on the broadcast hot
	// path — twice per BroadcastMasked call per client, at up to one frame
	// per second per car — and it was previously a plain map written once at
	// handshake and thereafter read with no synchronisation at all. That was
	// safe only while nothing ever wrote to it again, which is exactly the
	// property MYR-602 had to give up: a trip window opens and closes on the
	// CLOCK, so a role can change under a live connection with no mutation
	// anywhere to hang a handshake off. Replacing the whole map under an
	// atomic pointer keeps the read lock-free (one atomic load) while making
	// the write a publish rather than a data race, and readers see either the
	// whole old table or the whole new one — never a half-updated one, which
	// for a role table would mean a caller masked as two different tiers on
	// two vehicles in the same frame.
	roles atomic.Pointer[roleTable]
	// defaultRole is the fallback role consulted ONLY when allVehicles=true
	// and the per-vehicle roles table has no entry for the requested
	// vehicleID. Set by the handshake to auth.RoleOwner for the dev-mode
	// NoopAuthenticator path (whose ResolveRole returns RoleOwner
	// unconditionally) so dev-mode clients receive role-projected frames
	// for every vehicle the server is broadcasting for, instead of the
	// empty Role("") deny-all sentinel that left them silently filtered
	// out (MYR-66). Production clients have allVehicles=false; defaultRole
	// is never consulted, so the fail-closed deny-all posture for clients
	// without an explicit roles entry is preserved.
	defaultRole auth.Role
	// subscribed tracks which of the client's owned vehicles are
	// currently active subscriptions. Initialized at handshake from
	// vehicleIDs (so a client that never sends subscribe/unsubscribe
	// receives every owned vehicle, matching pre-MYR-46 behavior).
	// subscribe ADDS to the set after an ownership check; unsubscribe
	// REMOVES. Mutations are guarded by subMu, NOT by Hub.mu, so the

	// just pulled must not receive another GPS frame during that handshake.

	// and writePump blocks on exactly three things: ctx.Done, c.send closing,
	// and a failed write. None of them can happen. gctx is cancelled only
	// after g.Wait() returns (handler.go), g.Wait() waits for writePump, and
	// Unregister — the only closer of c.send — runs after that. Circular
	// wait: the session's goroutines and its hub entry survive forever.
	//
	// Before the enqueue guard, the 15s heartbeat was the accidental escape
	// hatch: BroadcastAll reached c.send, writePump woke, the write failed on
	// the dead connection, and teardown followed. The guard closed that door,
	// so the wake-up has to be explicit.
