// against a real Postgres by TestVehicleRepo_GetDispatchState (the gate arm) and
// the catalog list tests.
//
// What matters here is the two-way correspondence with the SQL, because the whole
// design rests on it: `ownerNamedPredicate` says a car's owner is NAMED exactly
// when the ladder is NOT NULL, and this function must produce a non-nil first name
// under exactly the same condition. The SQL's `TRIM`/`NULLIF` is what makes that
// hold for whitespace-only names — hence the arms below that look redundant.
