// queryRevokeSharesReceived tombstones every live grant the deleted user

// every grant ON a car). Revocation is a tombstone, not a delete (migration
// 0020): the owner's audit trail of who could see their car outlives the
// viewer's account. `status <> 'revoked'` makes a re-run affect zero rows
// instead of re-stamping revoked_at, so the step is idempotent.
// `revoked_by = 'grantee'` (migration 0051, MYR-609): the person holding the
// grant ended it, by deleting their account. It is the same author the §7.5.7
// leave stamps and for the same reason — this is the grantee's own act — and it
// is inert for the §7.5.8 extend gate that reads the column, since the owner
// can no longer name a grantee who does not exist.

// queryScrubSharesReceivedLabel erases the owner-typed label from every share
// row the deleted user had REDEEMED (MYR-447).
//
// WHAT THE LABEL IS, AND WHY IT OUTLIVING THE PERSON IS THE BUG. `label` is a
// free-text name the CAR OWNER typed for their own list — "Mira Chen", "Mom",
// "Roommate" (data-classification.md §1.15). It is P1, it is a third party's
// name, and it is the deleted user's name. Revocation alone (the step above)
// leaves it in place forever: `queryRevokeSharesReceived` moves `status` and
// stamps `revoked_at` and touches nothing else, so before MYR-447 a person
// could delete their account and have their name persist indefinitely in a
// stranger's row, keyed by a cuid that resolves to nothing.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE STATEMENT rather than another SET clause on the
// revoke. The revoke is guarded by `status <> 'revoked'` for idempotency, which
// means it deliberately skips rows that were ALREADY revoked — by the owner, or
// by an earlier partial run of this very sequence. Those rows carry the same
// name and are exactly as stale, so folding the scrub into the revoke would
// leave the oldest and most-forgotten labels untouched. This statement is
// therefore keyed only on the person, not on the status.
//
// SCRUB VALUE. `label` is TEXT NOT NULL (migration 0020) so the scrub writes
// the empty string rather than NULL — chosen over widening the column because
// `store.CreateInvite` rejects a blank label at the door, which makes the empty
// string an unambiguous scrubbed-here sentinel that no live row can hold. The
// `label <> ”` predicate then makes a re-run affect zero rows, so the step is
// idempotent on the same terms as every other step in the sequence.
//
// NO WIRE EFFECT. A revoked grant is never serialized to any client (`status`
// has no `revoked` wire member), and the label was owner-facing only — it is
// never delivered to the invited party. So the owner loses a name on a row they
// can no longer see, and nobody's UI changes.

// a re-run is a clean no-op.
//
// This is deliberately a DELETE rather than a tombstone: go_push_devices is an

// A DELETE rather than a tombstone, and this is the one step in the sequence
// where that choice is not merely conventional. The rows hold AES-256-GCM
// ciphertext of where this person LIVES (data-classification.md §1.17) — a
// durable home coordinate, not a one-off trip. A tombstone would keep exactly
// that ciphertext around after somebody exercised their right to erasure, and
// no counterparty is owed a record that this account once knew its owner's
// address: unlike a revoked share, which is evidence in the CAR OWNER's audit
// trail, a saved place is a person's own note to themselves. Nothing outlives
// them here.

// queryDeleteUserActivityForUser drops the person's last-seen row (MYR-592,

//
// A DELETE rather than a tombstone, and the reason is the value's TIER rather
// than its shape. The row is a cuid and one timestamp, but the timestamp is a
// BEHAVIOURAL observation about a person — when they were last using the
// product — which is why it is classified P1 (data-classification.md §1.21)
// while its structurally identical neighbour go_profile_name_confirmations is
// P0. Keeping a behavioural record after somebody has exercised their right to
// erasure is exactly the thing erasure is for, and no counterparty is owed it:
// unlike a revoked share, nobody else's audit trail contains this fact.
//
// It also has to go for a plainer reason. The inactivity sweeper reads this
// table; a surviving row for a deleted account is a person the sweeper still
// believes in. Today nothing follows from that (the candidate query joins from
// a live vehicle, and the account's vehicles went in step 3), but the row would
// be waiting for the first query that forgets to.

//
// HYGIENE RATHER THAN AN ERASURE OBLIGATION, which is the difference from its
// neighbour above and worth stating so a later reader does not assume the
// stronger duty applies here too. Every column is P0
// (data-classification.md §1.23): an opaque cuid, three timestamps about a
// PLATFORM ACTION, and a copy of an expiry integer. Nothing in it is a
// behavioural observation about the person, and nothing in it is a credential —
// the grant itself lives encrypted on the "Account" row that step 10 removes.
//
// It goes anyway, for the reason the last-seen row's comment gives second: a
// surviving row is an account the keepalive arm still holds a cooldown for,
// keyed by a cuid nothing resolves. Nothing follows from that today — the
// candidate query joins from a live suspended vehicle (gone in step 3) and a
// live Tesla OAuth row (gone in step 10), so the arm cannot reach it — but a
// row waiting for the first query that forgets to join is exactly the orphan
// class this sequence exists to prevent.
//
// Deleting zero rows on a re-run is a clean no-op, and zero is the ordinary
// result: a row exists only for an owner the keepalive arm has actually tried.
//

//
// THE TOMBSTONE PROTECTS A LIVE ACCOUNT AND NOTHING ELSE. Its whole job is to
// stop the best-effort post-link sync (OwnerProvisioner.UpsertOwnedVehicle)
// re-inserting a VIN the owner deliberately removed. That sync runs only for an
// account with a Tesla link, and after this sequence there is no account, no
// link and no sync — so a surviving row defends against a code path that can no
// longer execute. What is left is a (user_id, VIN) pair filed against a person
// who no longer exists, which is the orphan class §1.4.2 and §1.4.3 are already
// written against. The client ruled it goes ("remove everything", 2026-08-20).
//
// ORDERING IS NORMATIVE AND THIS IS THE ONE STEP IN THE 8-FAMILY THAT HAS ONE.
// Step 3 — the per-vehicle teardown — WRITES a tombstone for every car it
// removes, in the same transaction as the Vehicle delete (§1.4.1). So this
// DELETE must run AFTER step 3, or the teardown simply re-creates every row it
// just removed and the account exits the sequence with a full set of fresh
// tombstones. Step 8e satisfies that; nothing after step 3 writes one.
//
// P0 throughout (data-classification.md §1.3): an opaque cuid, an opaque Tesla
// vehicle id, a redactable VIN and a timestamp. Removing it is hygiene rather
// than an erasure obligation, like 8d and unlike 8c.

// (MYR-599, migration 0046) — the record that they linked a car somebody else
// owns, and their acknowledgment that the owner approved it.
//
// ORDERING IS NORMATIVE, the second step in the 8-family for which that is true
// and for the same mechanical reason as 8e: step 3's per-vehicle teardown
// deletes these rows car-for-car in its own transaction, so anything this
// statement finds is a row the teardown could not reach — a driver-access row
// whose "Vehicle" is already gone (a partial earlier run), or one for a car the
// teardown skipped. Running it BEFORE step 3 would be harmless but pointless;
// running it after is what makes "zero rows survive" true.
//
// THE EVIDENCE IS NOT DESTROYED BY THIS. The `vehicle.owner_approval_acknowledged`
// AuditLog row records that this person acknowledged, when, and under which copy
// version, and audit rows deliberately outlive the accounts they are about
// (data-lifecycle.md §3). What goes here is the standing per-vehicle state — an
// open push gate and a `teslaAccessType` claim — which is exactly the orphan
// class §1.4.2 and §1.4.3 are written against once the account is gone.
//
// P0 throughout (data-classification.md §1.24): two opaque cuids, Tesla's role
