// The MEMBER third of the vehicle catalog (MYR-540).
//
// vehicle_repo_list.go answers "cars you own"; vehicle_repo_list_shared.go
// answers "cars somebody shared with you". This file answers the last way a
// car can legitimately be in somebody's catalog: "the car serving a LIVE group
// ride you joined". Without it a joiner's §7.0 read omits the ride's vehicle,
// and the app's watched-vehicle ladder — which resolves against the catalog —
// falls back to "no such car" while the WS access set (internal/auth's third
// UNION leg) would happily admit a subscription. The catalog and the access
// set must name the same cars, and this query is deliberately the catalog
// restatement of that leg's predicate.

// memberSummaryJoin is the live-membership join. Like sharedSummaryJoin above
// it IS the access check, so every predicate that decides access sits in the
// JOIN: only vehicles serving a NON-TERMINAL ride the caller holds a
// membership row on survive. The status list is character-for-character the
// one internal/auth's queryUserVehicleIDs third leg carries — a catalog that
// listed a car the handshake refuses (or vice versa) would be the worst of
// both answers.
//
// Aliases are mr/gm, NOT r: vehicleListHasActiveRideExpr nests an EXISTS whose
// own alias is r, and shadowing it from the outer query would make that
// predicate read as correlated when it is not.

// queryVehiclesForRideMember is the member-side companion of
// queryVehiclesSharedWithUser: the identical lean projection, with the
// capability column a literal FALSE — membership conveys the ZERO grant
// (viewer tier, no ride capability), exactly what internal/auth's
// resolveRidingMember resolves for the same caller on the same car.
//
// The literal keeps the scan in lockstep with scanSharedVehicleSummaryRow
// rather than forking a second column list that must be maintained in
// parallel; the rows are re-typed at the adapter boundary. Every column the
// other two catalog reads gain has to be added HERE too, in the SAME position,
// for exactly that reason — MYR-592's telemetry-suspension expression is the
// most recent, after MYR-581's owner-name one.
//
// DISTINCT ON collapses the residual double-membership case (a reservation
// plus an instant ride on one car — the same boundary rest-api.md's
// "instant ↔ reservation" bullet documents) to one catalog row.
