// Vehicle catalog-list read path. Split out of vehicle_repo.go so the
// wide-read path (full Vehicle row + GPS dual-read + nav-route blob
// resolution) stays adjacent to its scan helpers and this file stays
// focused on the slim projection.
//
// MYR-122: `GET /api/vehicles` was reading 37 columns per row including
// the six `*Enc` GPS shadows and the `navRouteCoordinatesEnc` blob,
// then decrypting all of them on every row. The handler only emits
// ~10 of those fields. This file provides the lean read companion to
// VehicleRepo.ListByUser: same WHERE clause, narrower SELECT, no
// JSON blob.
//
// MYR-515 narrowed that "no decryption" clause rather than breaking it: the
// projection now carries ONE of the three GPS pairs — `latitudeEnc` /
// `longitudeEnc` — and decrypts it per row, because VehicleSummary.location
// emits it. The invariant this file actually enforces is stated as "MUST NOT
// SELECT columns the response body doesn't emit", and that still holds. The
// other two pairs (destination, origin) and the nav-route blob remain out;
// they were the expensive part, and nothing on the catalog emits them.
//
// AGENTS.md "Performance invariants": list endpoints use lean
// projections; wide selects belong only in detail/edit handlers.

	// TrimLabel is the DISPLAY-SAFE trim label (MYR-507), LEFT JOINed from the

	// (MYR-320), not a second copy of it.

	// OwnerFirstName is the FIRST NAME of the person who owns this car

	// supplies a name only on the first authorization). The empty string is
	// deliberately unreachable — TRIM/NULLIF in the SQL and the token reduction
	// in Go both collapse to nil — so "nameless" has exactly one spelling.
	//

	// and a gate that calls the owner nameless cannot coexist.

	// TelemetrySuspendedAt is when owner-inactivity suspension removed this
	// vehicle's fleet-telemetry config (MYR-592), LEFT JOINed from the Go-owned
	// go_vehicle_telemetry_suspensions episode row (migration 0044).
	//
	// A POINTER, and nil is the ordinary state: streaming is configured. Nil
	// covers three storage states a consumer must never be asked to tell apart
	// — no episode row, an episode warned but not yet suspended, and an episode
	// a reconnect cleared. Only the third column of that table is a fact about
	// the car's connection; the warning is bookkeeping and stops here.
	//
	// It is NOT on "Vehicle" and could not have been: CG-DL-9 forbids a Go
	// migration from naming a Prisma-owned table (migration 0044's header
	// argues it in full).

	// Trim is the RAW BADGE CODE ("p100d"), carried since MYR-578 as the second

	// Latitude / Longitude are the car's freshest known position (MYR-515),
	// decrypted from the `latitudeEnc` / `longitudeEnc` shadows — the SAME

	//
	// An ATOMIC PAIR: both non-nil or both nil, never one. resolveGPSPair
	// enforces that (a half-pair is corruption and surfaces no location), which
	// is why these are two pointers rather than two floats — the wire shape
	// above them is a single nullable object for the same reason.
	//
	// Nil means the server holds no fix. Note this is NOT the same as the
	// (0, 0) sentinel: a car that has genuinely streamed 0,0 decrypts to a
	// non-nil pair here and is collapsed to null at the WIRE layer, not here,

	// picker (MYR-437) must be able to show a shared car as "setting up" rather
	// than omitting it or badging it "offline", and it cannot fetch a snapshot
	// per row to find out. Zero value (Present false) means "no claim", which

	// DriverAccess is the car's go_vehicle_driver_access row (MYR-599), LEFT
	// JOINed alongside the schedule. RAW STORAGE behind the derived
	// VehicleSummary.teslaAccessType and the `awaiting_owner_acknowledgment`
	// setup state. The catalog carries it for the same reason it carries the
	// schedule: the picker and the Settings list must be able to say "you drive
	// this car" and "waiting on your acknowledgment" without a per-row snapshot
	// fetch. Zero value (Present false) reads as owner access, which is the safe
