// AccountDeleter is the store-side half of user-initiated account deletion
// (MYR-355, FR-10.1/FR-10.2, docs/contracts/rest-api.md §7.6). It owns the
// account-scoped steps that are pure SQL; the ORDER of the whole deletion —
// and the two steps that must run through existing application machinery
// (per-vehicle teardown, guarded ride cancellation) — lives in
// telemetry.AccountDeletionHandler, because those steps publish events and
// only the handler holds those seams.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT ONE TRANSACTION. The per-vehicle teardown
// (store.OwnerTeardown) is already its own transaction, by design: it takes
// FOR UPDATE locks over the owner's vehicle set to make the last-vehicle
// decision race-safe, and it fires a `vehicle_deleted` NOTIFY whose consumers
// must not observe an uncommitted delete. Wrapping N teardowns plus a ride
// cancellation that publishes push notifications inside one outer transaction
// would either deadlock against those locks or emit notifications for work
// that a later rollback undid. So the deletion is a SEQUENCE of independently
// atomic steps, and the property we buy instead of one-shot atomicity is that
// **every step is idempotent and the sequence is RE-RUNNABLE**: a mid-failure
// leaves the account partially deleted, the endpoint answers 500, and calling
// it again resumes from wherever it stopped. The steps are ordered so that
// resuming is always possible — the identity rows the caller authenticates
// with are deleted LAST, so a failure never locks the user out of finishing
// their own deletion.
//
// Contract position (data-lifecycle.md §1.4 / §3): this extends the MYR-258
// owner-teardown carve-out from "one vehicle" to "the account", and moves
// ownership of the FR-10.1 deletion transaction from the Next.js app to the Go
// server, because the native iOS client (P9) never talks to the Next.js app at
// all. The `account_deleted` AuditLog row that §3.1 assigns to Prisma is now
// written here, in the same transaction as the identity delete (CG-DL-3).

	// — the deleted person's NAME, written by somebody else — was erased
	// (MYR-447). A count, never the labels: they are P1 and the audit row is
	// P0-only (CG-DL-5). Counted separately from SharesRevoked because the two
	// steps deliberately cover different row sets: revocation skips rows that
	// were already revoked, the scrub does not.
	ShareLabelsScrubbed int `json:"shareLabelsScrubbed"`
	// PushDevicesDeleted is the number of APNs registrations removed.
	PushDevicesDeleted int `json:"pushDevicesDeleted"`
	// SavedPlacesDeleted is the number of saved Home/Work rows removed —
	// 0, 1 or 2. A COUNT, never the places themselves: the coordinates are P1
	// and the audit row is P0-only (CG-DL-5), so what is recorded is that two
	// rows went, never where they pointed.
	SavedPlacesDeleted int `json:"savedPlacesDeleted"`
	// ProfileNameConfirmationsDeleted is the number of display-name confirmation
	// rows removed — 0 or 1 (MYR-583), since the table's primary key is the user
	// id. A COUNT, and there is nothing else it could be: the row holds an
	// opaque cuid and a timestamp and never held the name (CG-DL-5 satisfied by
	// the table's shape, not just by this field). Recorded because the audit row
	// is how a deletion is shown to have reached every table that named the
	// person, and "did we take the consent record too" is a question the trail
	// must answer.
	ProfileNameConfirmationsDeleted int `json:"profileNameConfirmationsDeleted"`
	// VehicleDriverAccessRowsDeleted is the number of driver-access rows removed
	// (MYR-599, §3.1 step 8f) — one per car this person linked but did not own,
	// usually 0. A COUNT and never the rows: they pair an opaque cuid with
	// Tesla's role token, which is P0, but the count is what the audit trail
	// needs and the shape of the field keeps the boundary obvious. Recorded
	// because "did the deletion reach the consent table" is precisely the
	// question an owner-side complaint would ask about a deleted driver.
	VehicleDriverAccessRowsDeleted int `json:"vehicleDriverAccessRowsDeleted"`
	// RideMembershipsDeleted is the number of GROUP-RIDE memberships the user

	// (MYR-592, §3.1 step 8c) — 0 or 1, since go_user_activity is keyed by the
	// user id. A count of a P0-only row (opaque cuid + timestamp; the P1
	// last-seen SIGNAL never leaves the server). Recorded so the audit trail
	// answers "did the deletion reach the activity table" the same way it
	// answers it for every sibling go_ table.
	UserActivityRowsDeleted int `json:"userActivityRowsDeleted"`
	// TeslaTokenKeepaliveRowsDeleted is the number of keepalive bookkeeping
	// rows removed (MYR-594, §3.1 step 8d) — 0 or 1, keyed by user id. Every
	// column of that table is P0 by design (it records that a rotation was
	// ATTEMPTED, never the credential), so the count is as safe as its
	// siblings above.
	TeslaTokenKeepaliveRowsDeleted int `json:"teslaTokenKeepaliveRowsDeleted"`
	// RemovedVehicleTombstonesDeleted is the number of removed-vehicle
	// tombstones removed (MYR-596, §3.1 step 8e) — one per car this person ever
	// removed, usually 0. A COUNT and never the VINs: the row pairs an opaque
	// cuid with a VIN, and a VIN is P1 (data-classification.md §2.1), so the
	// only thing this field may carry across the CG-DL-5 boundary is how many
	// went. Recorded because the audit trail is how a deletion is shown to have
	// reached every table that named the person, and this is the last go_ table
	// that used to be exempt.
	RemovedVehicleTombstonesDeleted int `json:"removedVehicleTombstonesDeleted"`
	// TripsDeleted is the number of TRIPS THIS PERSON CREATED that were
	// removed (MYR-602, §3.1 step 8g). The three child tables cascade off
	// go_trips.id, so this one count stands for the participants, the
	// push-to-start tokens and the legs that went with them. A count and never

	// thing that may cross the CG-DL-5 boundary is how many windows closed.
	TripsDeleted int `json:"tripsDeleted"`
	// TripParticipationsDeleted is the number of memberships this person held
	// on OTHER people's trips (MYR-602, §3.1 step 8g). Separate from the count

	// opened, the other is windows they were invited into, and a deletion has
	// to be shown to have reached both directions.
	TripParticipationsDeleted int `json:"tripParticipationsDeleted"`
	// TripActivityTokensDeleted is the number of ActivityKit push-to-start
	// registrations removed (MYR-602, §3.1 step 8g). A COUNT and never a
