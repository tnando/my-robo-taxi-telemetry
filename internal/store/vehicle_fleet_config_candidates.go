// queryFleetConfigCandidates lists owned vehicles that have gone quiet and are
// DUE another attempt, soonest-due first.
//
// Why each predicate is here:
//
//   - `length("vin") = 17` — the MYR-257 provisioning INSERT can seed a row
//     before Tesla supplies a VIN, and there is nothing to push against one.
//     ("lastUpdated" is NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, so a car that has
//     never streamed carries its provisioning timestamp rather than a NULL;
//     there is deliberately no IS NULL arm, which would also defeat an ordered
//     index scan.)
//   - the `"Account"` EXISTS — a config push needs the owner's Tesla OAuth
//     token, so a vehicle whose owner has no tesla Account can never be healed
//     here and must not occupy a slot in the limit. A SEMI-join, not a plain
//     JOIN: the "Account" unique index is (provider, providerAccountId), NOT
//     (userId, provider), so one user may legitimately hold several tesla rows
//     and a plain join would emit the same vehicle once per row — doubling the
//     Tesla calls and eating the budget.
//   - the `go_removed_vehicles` NOT EXISTS — tombstone-wins (MYR-261). Matched
//     on tesla_vehicle_id OR vin, and that OR is load-bearing rather than
//     belt-and-braces: "Vehicle"."teslaVehicleId" is NULLABLE, and a NULL makes
//     `rv.tesla_vehicle_id = v."teslaVehicleId"` evaluate to NULL, which makes
//     NOT EXISTS true and ADMITS the row. A guard that opens when its join key
//     is missing is inverted, and the consequence is resurrecting a car its
//     owner deliberately removed. go_removed_vehicles carries `vin` for exactly
//     this correlation.
//   - the go_vehicle_driver_access NOT EXISTS (MYR-599) — CONSENT-WINS, and it
//     is the strongest gate in this query because it is the only one that
//     protects somebody who is not our user. A car linked by a DRIVER is
//     provisioned like any other, but nothing may be pushed at it until that
//     driver acknowledges the owner approved it, and the reconciler is the one
//     actor here that would otherwise do so unattended, on a background pass,
//     for as long as the car kept not streaming. Unlike the tombstone guard
//     above it needs no OR: `vehicle_id` is this table's primary key and is
//     never NULL, so the anti-join cannot open on a missing join key.
//   - the attempt-schedule arm — a car is due when it has never been attempted
//     or its backoff has elapsed. Ordering by OUR schedule rather than by
//     "lastUpdated" is what stops unfixable cars permanently occupying the
//     LIMIT (see migration 0031).
//
// THE STALENESS ARM HAS AN EXEMPTION AS OF MYR-529, AND IT IS THE FIX FOR THE
// BUG THAT ISSUE WAS FILED ABOUT. `v."lastUpdated" < $1` demands thirty minutes
// of total silence on the "Vehicle" row before a car may be examined at all —
// which is correct for the steady state and catastrophic for the first half
// hour after a link, because that is the ONLY window in which virtual-key
// pairing happens. Joey Verrone's car (linked 2026-08-10 01:22Z) proved the key
// paired at 01:23:10 and was scheduled for 01:38, but its "Vehicle" row kept
// being written by ordinary provisioning and web-sync traffic (01:41:33), so
// the staleness arm excluded it from every pass — the schedule said "due" and
// the listing never returned it. A car with a LIVE PAIRING EPOCH
// (`signed_command_at >= $4`) is therefore admitted on its schedule alone. It
// is a strictly narrower exemption than it looks: the epoch is stamped only by
// proof of pairing, it ages out of the hot window in minutes, and the caller's
// first act on such a candidate is a free row-shaped streaming check that costs
// Tesla nothing (see telemetry.reconcileOne).
//
// A READ of the Prisma-owned "Vehicle" and "Account" tables; the
// data-lifecycle.md §1.4 carve-outs constrain WRITES only.
// The MYR-489 columns (last_outcome, last_attempt_at, signed_command_at,
// forced_repush_at) come from the SAME left-joined row the backoff already
// reads, so the escalation decision costs no extra query — and, because it is
// one row, cannot be inconsistent with the attempt_count it is judged against.
