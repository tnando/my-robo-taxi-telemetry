// The link-time seed for the MYR-491 setup state.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT SCOPE CREEP. MYR-491 puts the setup state on the wire, and
// the state is read from go_fleet_config_attempts. But nothing WRITES a row to
// that table until the reconciler examines the car, and the reconciler only
// examines a car whose "Vehicle" row has been quiet for Staleness (30 minutes),
// on a pass that runs every Interval (15 minutes). So a brand-new owner has NO
// schedule row for the first half hour of their life with the product — which
// is exactly the window MYR-503 happened in: Amruth linked at 02:10Z and tapped
// Lock at 02:14Z. Without this seed, the card MYR-491 exists to render would
// have been blank for his entire encounter with the bug it was written about.
//
// The evidence is already in hand at link time and was being thrown away. The
// owner-onboarding config push fires inside the OAuth callback, necessarily
// BEFORE virtual-key pairing, and Tesla answers it with an explicit per-VIN
// `missing_key`. ownerStreamHook logged that and moved on. This persists it.
//
// WHY IT CHANGES NOTHING ABOUT MYR-489's BEHAVIOUR — the property to preserve,
// since PR #385 landed hours ago and its scheduling is delicate:
//
//   - attempt_count 0 and next_attempt_at = now make the seeded row
//     SCHEDULING-IDENTICAL to no row at all. The candidate query admits a
//     vehicle when `fa.vehicle_id IS NULL OR fa.next_attempt_at <= now`, and
//     the backoff is computed from attempt_count, so a car with this row is
//     picked up at precisely the same moment, with precisely the same first
//     backoff, as one without it. Seeding attempt_count 1 (what
//     RecordFleetConfigAttempt would have written) would have doubled that
//     first gap — a small instance of the very backoff poisoning MYR-489
//     Hole 2 was about.
//   - ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING. A re-link, a re-add, or a second link callback
//     must never overwrite a live schedule: clobbering last_outcome would
//     disarm a pending synced-not-streaming escalation, and resetting the
//     backoff would let an unpairable car be retried on every re-link.
//
// AND IT FIXES A GAP IN MYR-489 AS A SIDE EFFECT, which is worth stating
// because it was not obvious: ResetFleetConfigScheduleOnPairing is an UPDATE
// with no upsert, on the reasoning that "a car with no row is healthy or not
// yet examined". True in general — but a car mid-onboarding has no row for the
// same first 30 minutes, and that is exactly when its owner pairs the key and
// sends their first command. The in-band pairing signal therefore no-opped for
// the population it was built for. With a row present from link time, it lands.
//
// MYR-517 WIDENED THE SEED FROM ONE OUTCOME TO EVERY DOOR, because prod showed
// the narrow version missing the car it was written for. Spencer White's
// "Tizzy" (linked 2026-08-09 18:07:47Z) has NO row to this day, while four
// other cars' rows persist — and the reason is that MYR-491 hung the seed off a
// single branch of the link-time push: the `missing_key` skip. Every OTHER
// terminal outcome of that push — it applied, it failed with a transport or
// proxy error, it was skipped for some other reason, the deployment has no
// signing proxy at all — left the car with no schedule row, and therefore
// invisible to the in-band pairing signal for as long as it kept not streaming.
//
// So the seed is now unconditional for every provisioned owned vehicle, and the
// OUTCOME is the variable: `awaiting_virtual_key` when Tesla said so,
// `push_failed` when the push genuinely failed, and '' — no claim — when no
// push was attempted or the push applied. That keeps the WIRE behaviour
// byte-identical to before (internal/telemetry.deriveSetupState maps '' and
// `push_failed`-with-no-epoch alike onto "no claim") and the SCHEDULING
// byte-identical (attempt_count 0 + next_attempt_at now is admitted by the
// candidate query at exactly the same instant as no row at all). The only thing
// that changes is that the row EXISTS, which is the one thing the self-heal
// machinery needs and could not assume.

// (internal/telemetry.outcomeAwaitingKey), repeated rather than imported
// because internal/telemetry is deliberately decoupled from this package — the
// same reason FleetConfigCandidate is declared twice.
//
// The duplication is guarded END TO END rather than by a string comparison:
// TestSeedFleetConfigAwaitingKey asserts the seeded row round-trips through

// outcome yields the `awaiting_virtual_key` wire state. A drift in either
// spelling breaks one of the two.
const SetupOutcomeAwaitingVirtualKey = "awaiting_virtual_key"

// SetupOutcomePushFailed is the go_fleet_config_attempts.last_outcome label
// meaning "the config push itself failed" — a transport error, a proxy error,
// or a Tesla status we could not read as an answer. Duplicated from
// internal/telemetry.outcomePushFailed for the same reason
// SetupOutcomeAwaitingVirtualKey is, and guarded the same way: the
// internal/telemetry derivation table asserts what this outcome yields on the
// wire (no claim, absent a live pairing epoch), and the store round-trip test
// asserts the label survives a write.
const SetupOutcomePushFailed = "push_failed"

// SetupOutcomeNone is the empty last_outcome: a row seeded because a vehicle

// wire-invisible and scheduling-identical to no row at all.

// SetupOutcomeAwaitingOwnerAck is the go_fleet_config_attempts.last_outcome
// label meaning "this car was linked by a DRIVER and NOTHING WAS PUSHED at it,
// because the driver has not yet acknowledged that the owner approved adding
// it" (MYR-599). Duplicated from internal/telemetry.outcomeAwaitingOwnerAck for
// the same reason its two neighbours above are duplicated.
//
// IT IS THE ONE LABEL IN THIS FILE THAT DESCRIBES A PUSH THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
// The other three are all answers to a push — Tesla refused it, it errored, it
// applied. This one is seeded INSTEAD OF a push, which is why it is also the
// one label the MYR-592 inactivity sweeper must exclude from its
// "configured and billing" set: there is no config at Tesla to delete, and a
// "your car has been disconnected" push to a driver whose car was never
// connected is worse than the pointless API call that precedes it.
//
// It is deliberately WIRE-INVISIBLE ON ITS OWN. deriveSetupState answers
// `awaiting_owner_acknowledgment` from the go_vehicle_driver_access row, which
// is the authoritative source and the thing §7.29 clears; this label exists so
// the schedule row can say WHY it is sitting there, and so the seed is never a
// silent no-claim row that later reads as an unexplained silence.

// this one statement instead of a lookup plus an insert that could race the
// provisioning INSERT that just ran.

// "seed on every door" and "never overwrite" have to hold together, and
// ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING is what makes the second one free.
//
// Best-effort by contract: an unknown VIN inserts nothing, an existing schedule
// row is left exactly as it was, and both are success. The caller treats a
// returned error as loggable and never fatal — this is a card, not a gate, and
