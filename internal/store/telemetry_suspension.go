// The EPISODE store for owner-inactivity telemetry suspension (MYR-592):
// go_vehicle_telemetry_suspensions (migration 0044), plus the one candidate
// query that decides which cars the sweeper looks at.
//
// ── THE POLICY THIS SERVES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Tesla bills Fleet Telemetry streaming PER VEHICLE. A car whose owner stopped
// opening the app streams frames nobody reads, every day, forever. The client's
// cost-control ruling (rest-api.md §7.27):
//
//   * FOUR days of owner silence → one warning push to the owner.
//   * FIVE days → remove the vehicle's fleet-telemetry config. Nothing else:
//     the OAuth grant, the virtual key, the vehicle row and every share survive,
//     which is exactly what makes the owner's re-connect a single call.
//
// ── STRICTLY THE OWNER'S ACTIVITY ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// EXPLICIT CLIENT RULING, and the reason the candidate query joins
// go_user_activity on `"Vehicle"."userId"` and on nothing else: a RIDER's or a
// VIEWER's usage does NOT defer suspension. A shared car whose owner has been
// away five days is suspended even while a rider is actively watching it. That
// is not an oversight to be "fixed" by widening the join — the platform is
// paying for a stream on the OWNER's behalf, and only the owner can decide to
// keep paying for it. Widening this join to any other party silently reverses
// the client's decision.
//
// ── WHY "CONFIGURED" IS A NEGATIVE PREDICATE ────────────────────────────────
//
// There is no `telemetry_configured BOOLEAN` anywhere in this schema; the state
// is inferred from go_fleet_config_attempts, which is SELF-DRAINING — the
// reconciler DELETES a vehicle's row the moment a config push succeeds
// (migration 0031). So "no row" means the push landed, and the only positive
// evidence of a MISSING config is a surviving row carrying one of the labels
// that says the push did not take. Those labels are enumerated in
// fleetConfigAbsentOutcomes below.
//
// Getting this wrong is cheap in one direction and expensive in the other, which
// is why the predicate is written as an exclusion. A car we wrongly think is
// configured costs one pointless (idempotent, already-best-effort) Tesla DELETE
// and one warning push about a car that was not streaming. A car we wrongly
// think is UNconfigured is never suspended and keeps billing forever, which is
// the entire failure the feature exists to prevent.
//
// P0 in full (data-classification.md §1.22). Opaque cuids and timestamps.

//
// Spelled as a SQL literal list rather than built from the store-side
// SetupOutcome* constants because this is a `const` statement, and the two
// spellings are held together by TestFleetConfigAbsentOutcomesCoverSetupLabels.
//
// THE EMPTY LABEL IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT from this list. SetupOutcomeNone (the
// empty string) is what the link-time hook seeds when the push APPLIED —
// owner_stream_hook_config.go returns it on the nil-error arm — so a car
// carrying it is configured and billing. Listing the empty label here would
// exempt exactly the healthiest cars in the fleet and quietly disable the
// feature for most of it.
//
// `awaiting_owner_ack` (MYR-599) joined the list for the plainest reason of
// all: the link-time hook seeds it INSTEAD OF pushing, so a car carrying it has
// never had a config created and there is nothing at Tesla to delete. Omitting
// it would cost a pointless Tesla DELETE and — far worse — a "your car has been
// disconnected" push to a driver whose car was never connected in the first
// place, about a state they cannot fix by reconnecting.
// `owner_access_required` (MYR-599) joined it for the same reason one step
// further on: Tesla ANSWERED the push and answered no. A refused POST installs
// nothing, so a car carrying this label has no config at Tesla either — the
// label reads like a permission problem, but its consequence for this list is
// identical to push_failed's.

// whose owner has not authenticated since the warning threshold.
//

// in Go by the sweeper against its own clock, so that the whole policy is
// testable without a database and so that widening a threshold never means
// editing SQL.
type InactiveOwnerVehicle struct {
	// VehicleID is the Prisma "Vehicle"."id" cuid — the key the episode row,
	// the fleet-config schedule and the §7.0 catalog all use.
	VehicleID string
	// VIN is what the Tesla config DELETE is addressed to. Redact in logs.
	VIN string
	// OwnerID is who gets the warning push. The rider is never notified: the
	// suspension is not their decision and not their bill.
	OwnerID string
	// VehicleName is the owner's own nickname for the car, for the push copy.
	// May be empty; push.vehicleLabel supplies the "Your car" fallback.
	VehicleName string
	// OwnerLastSeenAt is the stamped instant from go_user_activity, up to the
	// stamper's throttle window stale — always in the conservative direction.
	OwnerLastSeenAt time.Time
	// WarnedAt is nil until this episode's day-4 push has been handed off.
	WarnedAt *time.Time
}

// queryInactiveOwnerVehicles selects configured, not-yet-suspended vehicles
// whose owner has been silent since $1.
//
// $1 = the WARN threshold (now - 4d), $2 = row cap.
//
// THE JOIN TO go_user_activity IS INNER, AND THAT IS THE SAFETY PROPERTY. An
// owner with no row has never been observed — a brand-new account, or any
// account that has not authenticated since migration 0043 shipped — which is
// materially different from an owner observed to be absent. An outer join would
// read a NULL last_seen_at as infinitely stale and suspend the entire fleet on
// the first pass after deploy. The inner join makes that outcome unreachable
// rather than merely unlikely: a vehicle becomes a candidate only once we hold
// positive evidence about its owner.
//
// THE DRIVER-ACCESS ANTI-JOIN IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH THE OUTCOME LIST ABOVE, and
// that is the whole reason it is here (MYR-599). `awaiting_owner_ack` is a
// go_fleet_config_attempts label, and that row is BEST-EFFORT — the link-time
// hook logs and shrugs if the seed write fails, and the teardown/reconciler
// delete it on other paths. So a driver-linked car with no schedule row at all
// passes `fca.vehicle_id IS NULL` and becomes a suspension candidate: the
// sweeper would warn its linker that a car which never streamed is about to be
// disconnected, and then spend a Tesla DELETE for a config that never existed.
// The driver-access row is NOT best-effort — it is written in the provisioning
// transaction — so gating on it is gating on the fact rather than on the
// explanation, exactly as the reconciler's candidate query does with the same
// shared `unacknowledgedDriverAccessGate` constant.
//
// ALREADY-SUSPENDED VEHICLES ARE EXCLUDED, which is what makes the sweeper
// idempotent. There is no second action to take on them, they must not be warned
// again, and they must not cost a Tesla call every hour for the rest of time.
// They leave this predicate only when the owner reconnects (which deletes the
// row) or unlinks (which deletes it with the car).
