// The VIEWER half of the vehicle catalog (MYR-184 / MYR-91 viewer merge).
//
// ListSummariesByUser (vehicle_repo_list.go) answers "cars you own" and is
// deliberately left untouched: owner rows must not change shape or cost because
// sharing shipped. This file answers the other half — "cars somebody shared
// with you" — as a separate lean read, and the handler concatenates the two.
// Two statements rather than one OR-joined statement keeps the owner path's
// index plan exactly as MYR-122 tuned it.

// sharedSummaryJoin is the accepted-grant join. The share row is the FILTER,
// not a decoration: only rows with a live accepted grant for this caller
// survive, so there is no way for the projection to emit a vehicle the caller
// was not granted. `status = 'accepted'` excludes both unredeemed invites and
// revoked tombstones.
//
// `s.suspended_at IS NULL` excludes SUSPENDED grants (MYR-369), and it belongs
// in the JOIN rather than the WHERE for a reason that is not stylistic: this
// join IS the access check, so every predicate that decides access must sit in
// it. A suspended grant therefore produces no catalog row at all — the vehicle
// vanishes from the viewer's list exactly as if the grant had been revoked,
// which is the specified behaviour. There is deliberately no "suspended" marker
// on the wire for a viewer to render: the row is absent, not decorated.

// sharedSummaryColumns is vehicleListSummaryColumns with every name qualified
// to the vehicle relation.
//
// The qualification is REQUIRED, not stylistic: go_vehicle_shares also has `id`
// and `status` columns, so the unqualified list is ambiguous the moment the
// grant join is added and Postgres refuses the statement outright (42702).
// Listing the columns again rather than reusing the shared constant is the cost
// of joining a table with overlapping names; the two lists must be kept in
// lockstep, and the scan function asserts the order.

// queryVehiclesSharedWithUser is the viewer-side companion of
// queryVehiclesByUserList: identical lean projection plus the grant's RIDE
// CAPABILITY, from which the handler DERIVES VehicleSummary.sharePermission
// without a second lookup (MYR-369).
//
// It selects `s.allow_rides`, NOT `s.permission`. The stored preset is not what
// the grant conveys — an owner may have patched the capability since, and a
// legacy row may still carry the retired live_history — so projecting the preset
// would emit a tier the server no longer enforces and, for that legacy row, one
// it no longer recognizes.
//
// MYR-581 threads the owner-name ladder through here too, and THIS is the role
// the field exists for: an owner reading their own list already knows whose car
// it is, while a viewer had no way at all to learn the name of the person whose
// car they were granted. Emitting it on both roles rather than the viewer alone
// keeps one projection for three producers — the alternative, a viewer-only
// column, would fork the scan.
//
// $2 is an OPTIONAL id filter. NULL means "every vehicle shared with me" (the
// catalog list); a non-null array narrows to a specific set (the redeem
// response, which reports only what that redemption granted). Expressing it as
// one statement keeps the two callers provably on the same access predicate —
// a second copy of this SQL is exactly where an access-control drift would hide.
