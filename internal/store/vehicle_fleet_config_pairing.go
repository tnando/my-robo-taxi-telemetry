// queryResetFleetConfigScheduleOnPairing opens a NEW pairing epoch for the
// vehicle owning vin and makes it immediately due, CREATING the schedule row
// when there is not one yet.
//
// WHY IT BECAME AN UPSERT (MYR-517). It was an UPDATE, on the reasoning that a
// car with no row is "healthy or not yet examined" and so has no backoff to
// reset and nothing to escalate later. The first half of that is true; the
// second half is what prod disproved. A car with no row that is NOT streaming
// is the exact population MYR-489 exists for, and dropping the write meant the
// strongest evidence the system ever receives — a signed command Tesla APPLIED,
// which proves both an enrolled virtual key and a reachable car — was thrown
// away for precisely those cars. Spencer White's onboarding is the worked
// example: no row, so his lock tap stamped nothing, and the pairing epoch that
// arms both the escalation budget and the MYR-491 `configuring` card was never
// opened.
//
// THE ROW IT CREATES IS A SEED, NOT AN ATTEMPT: attempt_count 0, last_outcome
// ” (no claim on the wire), next_attempt_at now (admitted by the candidate
// query at exactly the same instant no row would have been). The ONLY new fact
// it records is signed_command_at, which is the fact worth keeping. Cardinality
// stays bounded by vehicles — the primary key is vehicle_id, so a thousand
// commands against one car still produce one row — and the caller does not turn
// a CREATED row into an immediate Tesla round-trip (see
// telemetry.handlePairingSignal), so this costs one INSERT and no upstream
// traffic.
//
// WHY THE OUTCOME IS NOT FILTERED. Every row in this table is by construction
// an UNSUCCESSFUL attempt or a seed, so "reset only pre-key outcomes" and
// "reset any outcome" differ only for token_failed / read_failed / push_failed
// — and an owner whose signed command just APPLIED has, by that very fact, a
// working token and a reachable car, which is precisely when those three
// deserve another look. Filtering would exclude the cases the evidence most
// clearly contradicts.
//
// THE DEBOUNCE IS LOAD-BEARING. An owner poking their new car sends commands
// in bursts. Without `signed_command_at < $3` a ten-tap burst would trigger ten
// immediate per-vehicle reconciles — ten signed Tesla round-trips — and would
// also keep sliding the epoch forward, which is the timestamp the escalation
// budget is measured against. One reset per debounce window per car. It rides
// the ON CONFLICT ... WHERE clause, so a debounced repeat returns no row and
// reads as "nothing to do" exactly as it did before.
//
// `created` comes back as the xmax test rather than as a second query: on a
// freshly inserted row the system column xmax is 0, and on a row updated by the
// conflict arm it carries the updating transaction. It is the standard way to
// tell an INSERT from an UPDATE inside one statement, and it keeps this a
// single round-trip.

// ScheduleCreated set so the caller can tell "this car had a live schedule I
