// CROSS-REPO COUPLING — READ BEFORE EDITING
// =========================================
// The AuditLog table is owned by the Next.js app's Prisma schema at
//
//   ../my-robo-taxi/prisma/schema.prisma  (model AuditLog)
//
// and provisioned by migration
//
//   ../my-robo-taxi/prisma/migrations/20260508211924_auditlog_table_and_append_only_triggers/
//
// per docs/contracts/data-lifecycle.md §1.4 / §4 (FR-10.2, NFR-3.29). The
// telemetry server holds Insert-only access to this table for system-
// initiated rows: drives_pruned, mask_applied, tokens_refreshed.
//
// Authority: the Prisma model is the schema source of truth. The columns
// declared in AuditEntry below MUST mirror the Prisma model exactly. Any
// change to either side (column add/rename/retype, classification tier,
// nullability) requires updating BOTH files in the SAME PR. contract-guard
// rule CG-DL-8 enforces this on every PR (see .github/workflows/
// contract-guard.yml and .claude/agents/contract-guard.md). Drift is a
// contract violation that blocks merge.
//
// Append-only invariant (NFR-3.29 / CG-DL-2):
//   * The DB enforces this via the prevent_audit_log_mutation() function
//     and the prevent_audit_log_update / prevent_audit_log_delete triggers
//     installed by the Phase 1 migration. Any UPDATE / DELETE raises
//     "AuditLog rows are append-only".
//   * This Go type ALSO refuses to expose mutation methods: AuditRepo
//     intentionally has only InsertAuditLog. Do NOT add Update / Delete /
//     Get / List methods here. If a query path is ever needed, callers
//     should read AuditLog through Prisma (the owner) — not by extending
//     this repo.
//
// IDs:
//   * Callers MUST supply a cuid-format id on every entry. This matches
//     the convention used by DriveRepo.Create / VehicleRepo upsert paths
//     elsewhere in this package (Go-side id generation, never relying on
//     Prisma's @default(cuid()) DB-side fallback). Generating the id at
//     the call site means the audit row's id is known to the caller for
//     downstream correlation (e.g., logging the inserted audit id in the
//     same transaction that mutated the affected entity).
//
// Classification:
//   * All columns are P0 per data-lifecycle.md §4.4. The metadata JSONB
//     MUST contain only opaque IDs / counts / enum values — never P1
//     values like coordinates, addresses, names, tokens, or emails.
//     contract-guard rule CG-DL-5 enforces this on every PR.
