// SQL for the MYR-184 vehicle-sharing surface (go_vehicle_shares, migration
// 0020). Kept in one file so the whole authorization-relevant statement set can
// be read at once — every WHERE clause here is an access-control decision.
//
// Two invariants hold across every statement below:
//
//  1. Owner-scoped mutations carry `owner_user_id = $n` IN THE STATEMENT. The
//     handler layer's ownership check is a courtesy that produces a good error
//     message; this predicate is what actually prevents one person mutating
//     another's invite, and it is enforced by the database on the same row it
//     writes, so there is no check-then-write window.
//
//  2. The redeem statement is a single conditional UPDATE guarded on
//     `status = 'pending' AND expires_at > NOW()`, with RETURNING. Losers of a
//     concurrent redemption update zero rows and are answered 404 — they never
//     observe a half-granted state.

// shareColumns is the full row projection, with `code` suppressed for any row
// that is not pending. The suppression is IN THE SQL, not in Go, so no read
// path can accidentally carry an accepted grant's code out of the database:
// ShareInvite.code is contractually present only while status is 'pending'.
const shareColumns = `
	id, vehicle_id, owner_user_id, label, permission, allow_rides, suspended_at,
	CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN code ELSE '' END AS code,
	status, created_at, expires_at, accepted_at,
	COALESCE(accepted_by_user_id, '') AS accepted_by_user_id, revoked_at,
	` + acceptedByNameExpr

// `acceptedByNameExpr` — the ACCEPTING account's resolved display name (MYR-581)
// — lives in vehicle_share_accepted_name.go. It is a bigger fragment than any
// other member of this projection and it carries its own argument about how it
// differs from `label`, so it is split out under the 300-line rule; nothing
// about its position in the column order changes (it is LAST, and
// `scanShare` reads it last).

// queryShareOwnedVehicleIDs filters a requested vehicle-id set down to the ones
// the caller actually owns. READ-ONLY against the sibling-owned vehicle
// relation (CG-DL-9 permits reads; it forbids writes and forbids naming the
// relation in migration SQL). The create path compares the returned count with
// the requested count and refuses the whole invite on any mismatch, so a set
// containing one foreign car mints nothing at all.
const queryShareOwnedVehicleIDs = `
SELECT "id" FROM "Vehicle" WHERE "id" = ANY($1) AND "userId" = $2`

// queryShareCodeInUse reports whether a candidate code is already backing a
// live pending invite. Codes are not unique in the schema (a multi-vehicle

// keeps a fresh mint from colliding with an outstanding one. See
// mintUnusedShareCode for the residual race and why it is acceptable.

// would make "expired" depend on two clocks agreeing.
const shareInviteTTLInterval = `INTERVAL '7 days'`

// queryInsertShare creates one pending invite row. Called once per vehicle in a
// multi-vehicle create, all rows sharing the code passed as $6.
//
// RETURNING hands back the timestamps the database actually wrote, so the row
// the caller returns to the client is the row on disk — not a Go-side
// approximation that drifts from it by however long the round trip took.
// $7 is the preset's allow_rides projection, seeded at INSERT rather than left
// to the column default so a pending row and the grant it becomes never

// The subquery is what makes the set the right one. Keying on the code (not on
// the owner, and not on the id) is deliberate in both directions: an owner may
// hold several unrelated pending invites, which a resend must not disturb, and
// one invite may span N vehicles, every one of which must be re-minted or the
// old code stays live on the rest. A NULL subquery result — no such pending row
// for this owner — matches nothing, which is how "not yours / not pending" falls
// through to the explain probe.

// FOR UPDATE is what serializes concurrent redemptions of one code: the second
// transaction blocks here, and when it proceeds the rows it re-reads are no

// actually changed.
//
// TIER-AT-REDEEM (MYR-369). `allow_rides` is computed FROM THE ROW'S OWN
// `permission` inside this UPDATE rather than passed in by the caller. That is
// what makes a pending invite minted before this change redeem to exactly the
// capabilities its preset always implied — including one minted at the retired
// live_history, which maps to false along with 'live'. Doing it in SQL keeps the
// mapping atomic with the accept: there is no window in which a row is accepted
// but not yet capability-stamped, and no Go-side value that could be computed
// from a stale read of `permission`.
//
// `suspended_at = NULL` is asserted too. A pending row cannot be suspended, so
// this is belt and braces against a row that somehow carried the column — a
// freshly accepted grant must never be born paused, because nobody would know
// to un-pause it.
// `updated_at` IS STAMPED HERE TOO (MYR-451), and it has to be: this statement
// MOVES A CAPABILITY. `allow_rides` goes false → true for a `rides` preset, and
// redemption is the only mutation other than the owner's patch that changes it.
// Leaving it unstamped would let a grant that acquired the ride capability at
// redemption still report the invite's creation instant — so the one question
// the column exists to answer ("when did this grant gain or lose rides, before
// or after the ride they took?") would be answered with a date that can be days

// surface: a suspended grant conveys nothing, so it must not be re-servable as a
// successful join, and the 404 keeps it indistinguishable from every other dead

//
// Only the FIRST NAME reaches the redeemer (P1 policy: first names only, same
// as the push payloads and RideRequest.requesterName) — the reduction to a first
// name happens in Go so the ladder stays one statement.
//
// MYR-581 added `TRIM` to every rung, and it FIXED A LATENT PRECEDENCE BUG rather
// than tidying anything. `NULLIF(x, ”)` alone treats a whitespace-only name as a
// PRESENT value, so a top rung holding "   " won the COALESCE outright and the
// rungs below it were never consulted — the Go-side reduction then collapsed it to
// "" and the caller fell through to the EMAIL local-part, skipping a perfectly
// good real name one rung down. With TRIM, whitespace-only is NULL at every rung
// and the ladder falls through as intended.
//
// MYR-583 LEFT THIS LADDER UNGATED BY CONFIRMATION, and the reason is the FALLBACK
// two lines down rather than any argument about consent. Every other reader of a
// display name renders nothing when the ladder resolves to nothing; this one falls
// through to the EMAIL LOCAL-PART (see vehicle_name.go). So gating it would not
// turn an unconfirmed name into an honest absence — it would turn "Amruth" into
// "amruth.kelkar", disclosing MORE about the owner to the person redeeming their
// invite than the unconfirmed first name did. A gate that makes the leak larger is
// not the gate the ruling asked for. If this surface is revisited, the fallback
// has to be revisited with it.
//
// It also makes this expression agree character-for-character with
// `ownerNameResolvedExpr` (owner_name.go). The two cannot yet be ONE constant — this
// one keys on `$1` and that one on `"Vehicle"."userId"`, and the statements that
// embed them are `const`, so a key-parameterized helper would have to make them
// all `var` — but they must at least AGREE, because both answer "what is this
// person called?" for the same P1 policy.
