// MYR-316: the service-window pair is the FIRST side-table data this lean

// alternative, an N+1 per-vehicle lookup from the handler, would be strictly
// worse on the very path MYR-122 exists to protect.
// MYR-342: the owner ride-sharing switch rides the SAME LEFT JOIN, so it costs
// nothing beyond one fixed-width boolean, and it IS emitted (as
// VehicleSummary.rideShareEnabled) — the invariant this projection actually
// enforces is "MUST NOT SELECT columns the response body doesn't emit".
// MYR-491: the setup schedule is the SECOND side-table join on this path, and
// it earns its place by the same invariant — all four values are emitted, as
// the single derived VehicleSummary.setupState. A per-vehicle follow-up read
// instead would be an N+1 on the catalog, and the rider-side picker is the
// consumer that most needs the value (MYR-437: "setting up", not "offline"), so
// it cannot be pushed onto the snapshot alone.
// MYR-581: the OWNER'S NAME rides no join at all — it is three correlated
// index probes per row (owner_name.go) — and it is emitted, as
// VehicleSummary.ownerFirstName, so the same invariant holds. It is on the
// catalog for the same reason `trimLabel` is: the catalog is the only
// vehicle-identity surface a RIDER has, and without it a shared car's owner can
// only be named by the display fallback, which is how "Tesla wants a ride" came
// to be a person.
// MYR-507: `trim_label` rides the SAME go_vehicle_control_state join as the two
// blocks above and is emitted verbatim as VehicleSummary.trimLabel, so the same
// invariant holds — one short text column, no new probe. It is on the catalog
// because the catalog is the ONLY vehicle-identity surface a rider has: viewers
// never read /snapshot, so without it a shared car can only be named by its
// colour, which is how "UltraRed" came to be a whole vehicle descriptor.

// The end-side predicate is deliberately gated on endTime: every Drive
// row is created with endTime and endAddress both set to the empty
// string (mapDriveStarted) and only gets a real endTime when the drive
// completes (handleDriveEnded). Without the endTime guard, a backfill
// run against a still-OPEN drive would match on an empty endAddress and
// reverse-geocode the LAST recorded routePoints entry — the car's
// current, still-changing position — and persist it as the drive's
// endLocation/endAddress, which is simply wrong (and would be
// immediately stale). The "endTime IS NULL OR endTime is empty" shape
// mirrors queryDriveListOpen's predicate: the cleanup-binary findings
// showed the column can be either representation depending on how the
// row was inserted.
//
// MYR-447 REWROTE the discovery predicate, and this is the one change in
// that issue that could not be a like-for-like column swap. The old
// predicate asked `"startAddress" = <empty string>`. AES-GCM ciphertext is
// nondeterministic — a fresh 12-byte nonce per encrypt — so a sealed
// address is a different base64 string every time it is written and can
// NEVER equal the empty string again. Kept verbatim against the `*Enc`
// columns, the predicate would match nothing, forever, and the geocode
// backfill would silently report "0 rows found" on a database full of
// unaddressed drives.
//
// The nullable-`*Enc` column shape is precisely what buys the fix: NULL
// is the absent sentinel (an empty label seals to "" and is persisted as
// NULL — see label_encryption.go), so "has no address" is expressible as
// `IS NULL`, which needs to compare nothing against the ciphertext.
//
// The endTime guard is untouched: endTime is not encrypted and keeps its
// original two-representation shape.
//
// One behavioural note for the rollout: a legacy row that HAS a plaintext
// startAddress but no ciphertext sibling matches this predicate and will
// be re-geocoded. Running `backfill-location-labels` first seals those
// rows and removes them from the result set, which is both cheaper and
// preserves the original geocode.
//
// MYR-447 (audit follow-up): the projection also carries the drive's
// vehicleId and that vehicle's OWNER, joined in from "Vehicle". Neither is
// used to select rows — the discovery predicate is byte-for-byte the one
// described above — they exist because `ops geocode backfill` decrypts
// every matching row fleet-wide and must write an operator_decrypt audit
// row naming the data SUBJECT before it transmits a single coordinate to
// Mapbox. The subject of a Drive is the owner of the car that drove it,
// and there is no other column on "Drive" that names them.
//
// The join is INNER, and that is safe rather than lossy: "Drive"."vehicleId"
// is NOT NULL with a foreign key to "Vehicle"."id", so every Drive row has
// exactly one matching Vehicle and the join cannot drop a row the old
// single-table SELECT would have returned. A row it DID drop would be a
// row with no identifiable owner — which the backfill must not decrypt
// anyway, because it could not be audited.
