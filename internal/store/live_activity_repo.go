// go_live_activities (migration 0025, MYR-172) is the ActivityKit push-token
// registry: one row per (ride, party) whose Live Activity is running on a
// phone. The activity-update sender in internal/push reads it to resolve a ride
// into the set of Activities to push a new content-state to.
//
// This is the sibling of go_push_devices, not a copy of it. A device token
// addresses an INSTALLATION for as long as the app is installed; an activity
// token addresses ONE RUNNING ACTIVITY for the length of one ride, and
// ActivityKit rotates it underneath us while the Activity is alive. That is why
// the natural key here is (ride_request_id, user_id) and registration REPLACES
// the token in place — see the migration header for the full argument.
//
// Activity tokens are P1 (data-classification.md §1.18). This repository never
// logs one and never returns one in an error string; callers that must log
// anything log an 8-character prefix via push.TokenPrefix.

// LiveActivity is one running Live Activity that can be pushed to.
type LiveActivity struct {
	// RideRequestID is the ride whose Activity this is. Empty on a row anchored
	// to a trip leg instead — migration 0047's CHECK makes exactly one of the
	// two anchors set, so exactly one of these two fields is populated by any
	// read.
	RideRequestID string
	// TripLegID is the trip leg whose Activity this is (MYR-602). Empty on a
	// ride row. See live_activity_trip_anchor.go for why one table carries
	// both.
	TripLegID string
	// UserID is the party running it. v1 only ever registers the rider.

	// full, never echo into a response or an error.

	// build and is therefore only valid against the APNs sandbox gateway.

	RideRequestID string
	UserID        string
}

// queryUpsertLiveActivity registers an Activity's update token, or replaces the
// token if one is already registered for this (ride, party).
//
// The conflict target is the (ride_request_id, user_id) pair, NOT the token.
// ActivityKit rotates the update token during the life of a single Activity, so
// the token is not a stable identity the way a device token is: keying on it
// would accumulate one row per rotation and leave the sender guessing which is
// live. Keying on the pair makes a rotation an ordinary re-registration.
//
// ended_at is reset to NULL on conflict. A client that re-registers is telling
// us it has a live Activity again; leaving a stale tombstone in place would
// silently exclude the row from every send path and the rider would watch a
// frozen lock screen with nothing in the logs to explain it.
//
// THE WRITE IS GUARDED IN SQL, and that is the point of the INSERT … SELECT
// shape (which otherwise buys nothing over a VALUES list).
//
// Clearing the tombstone is the right behaviour for the case it was written
// for — an ordinary token rotation on a ride that is still happening — and
// exactly the wrong one for a ride whose Activity was ended for good. There are
// two such endings and they fail differently:
//
//   - A TERMINAL RIDE STATUS. The handler checks this before calling, but the
//     check is a read and this is the write, so a POST that arrives while the
//     ride is transitioning would re-register after the terminal `event: "end"`
//     had already tombstoned the row. Narrowing that window is not a fix;
//     making the guard part of the write is.
//   - A RESERVATION THAT EXPIRED. The sweeper ends and tombstones the
//     Activities but leaves the ride at `accepted` (it records the give-up in
//     the dispatch columns instead), and dispatched_at is latched, so nothing
//     can ever expire the ride a second time. Without this predicate a single
//     token rotation after the expiry would resurrect the row and the ETA
//     ticker would resume a countdown to a pickup that is never coming.
//
// Both predicates are COALESCEd because NULL is the ordinary state of
// dispatch_status: `NOT (NULL = 'failed' AND …)` is NULL, not TRUE, which would
// silently reject every registration on a ride that has not dispatched yet.
//
// A guard miss affects zero rows, which RegisterActivity reports as
// ErrLiveActivityClosed. Note this deliberately does NOT refuse every
// dispatch failure: a nav push that failed for any other reason leaves a ride
// that is still genuinely happening (the owner can drive it manually), and its
// Activity must keep rotating tokens.
//
// THE EXPIRED-RESERVATION REFUSAL IS SCOPED TO `accepted` (MYR-461), and that
// third conjunct is the whole fix. `reservation_expired` is a verdict on the
// DISPATCH — the car never drove itself to the pickup inside the lateness
// ceiling — and the sweeper deliberately leaves the ride row at `accepted`
// because nobody declined and nobody cancelled. Refusing registration on that
// verdict alone conflated "the car never went by itself" with "the ride is
// over", and the two come apart exactly when the humans rescue the ride by
// hand: the owner taps Picked up, the rider taps Start ride, the owner taps
// Dropped off. That ride runs for another hour with a rider on board, and the
// unscoped guard locked its Live Activity out for good — every re-registration
// answered 409 while the trip was visibly happening. Prod evidence: ride
// c8b316c8… on 2026-08-03 expired at scheduledFor+30m, then went
// arrived → enroute → completed over the following 99 minutes with the rider's
// card dark the entire time.
//
// The ride's own status is the authority on whether a ride is over, and the
// first conjunct already enforces it. So the expiry refusal now only holds
// while the reservation is STILL nothing but an expired reservation. The
// moment the ride advances to `arrived` or `enroute` the expiry verdict has
// been falsified by events — the car is demonstrably at the kerb — and the
// Activity is allowed back. A reservation nobody rescued stays refused, which
// is the MYR-172 intent: no fresh card counting down to a pickup that will
// never come.
//
// A FRESH REGISTRATION IS SEEDED AT THE RIDE'S CURRENT PHASE, not at zero
// (MYR-398, migration 0029). The app starts the Activity locally and draws the
// current state itself, so the island has just been in front of the rider —
// expanding it to announce the phase they are already looking at would be an
// unearned interruption at the very start of every ride. Seeding says "that one
// has happened"; the first genuine transition after it is what earns the first
// expansion.
//
// Seeded from the STATUS ALONE, so it cannot express Arriving (which needs the
// car's ETA). That is the right way round: a rider who registers while the car
// is already ninety seconds out has genuinely not seen an Arriving expansion,
// and gets it on the next tick.
//
// The CONFLICT branch leaves the mark alone on a LIVE row, exactly as it leaves
// the progress anchor alone and for the same reason: a token rotation is the
// same Activity mid-ride, and re-zeroing it would run the whole ladder again.
// Leaving it alone is also what keeps a phase the phone is still OWED — one
// whose APNs send failed, so the mark was deliberately not raised — available
// for the next attempt.
//
// ON A TOMBSTONED ROW IT RE-SEEDS, and the asymmetry is the point. Re-registering
// after an end is a supported flow (the handler documents it: a client that
// re-registers is telling us it has a live Activity again), and it means a NEW
// Activity — started locally by the app, which has just drawn the current state
// itself. Clearing the tombstone while leaving a mark of 1 from the `requested`
// registration would let the next push announce `enroute` as On trip (5 > 1) and
// expand an island over a card the app drew a moment ago: precisely the unearned
// interruption the INSERT-side seeding exists to prevent. GREATEST rather than a
// plain assignment because the status can only express the status: an Activity
// that had genuinely earned Arriving (3) must not be pulled back to the
// status-only Enroute (2) and made to earn it twice.
