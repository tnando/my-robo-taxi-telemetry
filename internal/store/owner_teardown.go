// OwnerTeardown is the single, audited, transactional path that removes ONE
// of an owner's cars across our backend (MYR-258,
// docs/architecture/car-offboarding.md). It is the exact inverse of
// store.OwnerProvisioner (MYR-257): where the provisioner upserts the
// Vehicle/Account/Settings identity rows on a completed Tesla link, the
// teardown deletes them on an owner "Remove this car".
//
// Like the provisioner it is a distinct, narrowly-scoped writer — NOT the
// identity module (ADR-001 §4 keeps identity's "User" access read-only; the
// User row is NEVER touched here) and NOT AccountRepo. It is gated behind the
// same contract carve-out: docs/contracts/data-lifecycle.md §1.4 grants Go
// owner-scoped DELETE on Vehicle/Account + the user-initiated vehicle_deleted
// AuditLog INSERT, and contract-guard CG-DL-3 requires that audit row inside
// the same transaction as the delete.
//
// Ownership is enforced at the SQL layer: every mutating statement is scoped
// `WHERE "userId" = <caller>`, so a teardown can NEVER touch another user's
// rows even if the HTTP layer's ownership check were bypassed. A single
// pgx.Tx makes the whole teardown atomic (CG-DL-3 / data-lifecycle §3.4): on
// any error nothing is deleted and no audit row is written. It is idempotent
// — removing an already-removed car affects zero rows and is a clean no-op
// success (no duplicate audit row).
