	// TopicVehicleTelemetryRaw carries every decoded proto field from a

	// when the receiver is configured with PublishRawFields (dev/debug
	// mode). The payload is RawVehicleTelemetryEvent.
	TopicVehicleTelemetryRaw Topic = "vehicle.telemetry.raw"

	// TopicConnectivity is published when a vehicle connects or disconnects

	TopicDriveEnded Topic = "drive.ended"

	// TopicDriveDiscarded is published when the drive detector drops an
	// active drive via the micro-drive filter (too short / too little
	// distance). The writer creates the Drive row on drive.started, so
	// without this signal a discarded micro-drive leaks an open row
	// with endTime unset (MYR-160). The payload is DriveDiscardedEvent;
	// the store subscriber deletes the row. Internal-only — never
	// broadcast to WS clients.
	TopicDriveDiscarded Topic = "drive.discarded"

	// TopicRideRequestCreated is published when a rider creates a ride
	// request (P10 ride-hailing, MYR-174). The payload is
	// RideRequestCreatedEvent. The WS broadcaster subscribes and unicasts
	// a summary `ride_request_created` frame to the two parties (rider +
	// vehicle owner) only.
	TopicRideRequestCreated Topic = "ride.request.created"

	// TopicRideStatusChanged is published on every ride-request lifecycle
	// mutation — rider cancel (MYR-174), owner accept/decline (MYR-175),
	// dispatch progress (MYR-176), reschedule sub-state (MYR-192). The
	// payload is RideStatusChangedEvent. The WS broadcaster subscribes and
	// unicasts a summary `ride_status_changed` frame to the rider + owner.
	TopicRideStatusChanged Topic = "ride.status.changed"

	// TopicRideAccepted is the dispatch seam (MYR-175): published once when
	// an owner accepts a ride request, carrying the pickup/dropoff places
	// and passenger contact MYR-176 needs to build the Tesla
	// navigation_request push. Internal-only — never broadcast to WS
	// clients (the WS accept signal travels on TopicRideStatusChanged as a
	// summary). No subscriber exists until MYR-176 lands; the bus tolerates
	// zero subscribers.
	TopicRideAccepted Topic = "ride.accepted"

	// TopicRideStarted is the leg-2 dispatch seam (MYR-270, was ride.boarded in
	// MYR-265): published once when the RIDER starts the ride (the guarded
	// arrived→enroute transition), carrying the DROPOFF place the nav-dispatch
	// pipeline pushes as the car's new destination. Internal-only — never
	// broadcast to WS clients (the WS start signal travels on
	// TopicRideStatusChanged as an `enroute` summary frame). Exactly-once per
	// start: only the winning arrived→enroute write publishes it.
	TopicRideStarted Topic = "ride.started"

	// TopicRideDue is the reservation-due seam (MYR-179): published once when
	// a SCHEDULED ride reaches its `scheduledFor` instant and its pickup nav
	// push has been DELIVERED — i.e. the sweeper won the leg-1 claim and the
	// push resolved `sent`. The payload is RideDueEvent. Internal-only — never
	// broadcast to WS clients (the client-visible signal is the same
	// `dispatchStatus` annotation an instant ride gets).
	//
	// Publication follows the push rather than the claim because the topic's
	// meaning is "your car is on the way": a reservation that resolved
	// `skipped` (the DISPATCH_ENABLED kill-switch), `failed` (token/VIN/command
	// error), or was expired past its lateness ceiling emits NOTHING. The latch
	// admits one winner, so a false event here could never be corrected by a
	// later one — the seam is pinned to the delivered outcome, not the
	// intention.
	//
	// NO subscriber exists yet; the bus tolerates zero subscribers and the
	// publish is fire-and-forget + drop-safe (a publish failure NEVER affects
	// the dispatch, which has already happened). It exists so the planned rider
	// push-notification has a seam to hang off without re-opening the dispatch
	// path. Exactly-once per due ride by construction: only the sweeper that
	// WON the `dispatched_at` claim can reach the publish, and that latch admits
	// one winner for the ride's whole lifetime.
	TopicRideDue Topic = "ride.due"

	// TopicRideNavUnapplied is the nav-share close-loop's failure seam
	// (MYR-527): published once when a leg's nav push resolved `sent` but the
	// car's own reported destination never converged on the shared target —
	// through the verification window AND one re-share. The payload is
	// RideNavUnappliedEvent. Internal-only — never broadcast to WS clients;
	// its consumer is the owner's "check the dash" push.
	TopicRideNavUnapplied Topic = "ride.nav_unapplied"

	// TopicRideTripChanged is the trip-edit seam (MYR-541): published once
	// per accepted pickup/drop-off PATCH. The payload is RideTripChangedEvent.
	// Internal-only — its consumers are the dispatcher's nav re-share and the
	// participants' pushes; the WS refetch signal travels on the TripEdit-
	// marked ride_status_changed frame instead.
	TopicRideTripChanged Topic = "ride.trip_changed"

	// TopicRideWaypointArrived is the car-reached-a-waypoint seam (MYR-538):
	// published once per (ride, waypoint) when the AUTO-ARRIVAL detector
	// observes a dispatched car parked inside the arrival radius of the ride's
	// pickup for the dwell window. The payload is RideWaypointArrivedEvent.
	// Internal-only — never broadcast to WS clients.
	//
	// Distinct from the accepted → arrived transition that fires alongside it,
	// and the distinction is the reason the topic exists. The STATUS says "this
	// ride has been picked up", and the owner's manual tap can say that from
	// anywhere. THIS says "the car is physically at the kerb, and telemetry is
	// how we know" — the only sound trigger for a consumer that acts on the car
	// itself. MYR-542's light flash is the first; there is no subscriber yet and
	// the bus tolerates zero.
	TopicRideWaypointArrived Topic = "ride.waypoint_arrived"

	// TopicRideMemberJoined is the group-ride membership seam (MYR-540):
	// published once, on the redemption that actually INSERTED a membership row,
	// when somebody joins a ride through its shared link. The payload is
	// RideMemberJoinedEvent. Internal-only.
	//
	// IT DELIBERATELY HAS NO CONSUMER IN v1, and that is the whole reason it
	// exists rather than being added later. There is no push for a join (the
	// client's call: the requester finds out by looking at the ride, and a
	// notification per joiner would be a group chat's worth of banners), and
	// there is no WS frame either — membership changes are picked up on the
	// refetch clients already perform, which is the standing discipline. What
	// the topic buys is that the FACT is on the bus at the one moment it is
	// unambiguous: the first consumer to want it — a "3 riding" nudge, an
	// analytics counter, a fraud signal on a link that spread too far — does not
	// have to reopen the redemption path to find the seam.
	TopicRideMemberJoined Topic = "ride.member_joined"

	// TopicVehicleDeleted is published when a Vehicle row is deleted from
	// the Prisma-owned "Vehicle" table (sourced from a Postgres
	// LISTEN/NOTIFY channel; see internal/store/notify_listener.go). The
	// payload is VehicleDeletedEvent. Consumers: the WS hub (close
	// subscribed clients with code 4002), the telemetry receiver (close
	// the active inbound mTLS stream for the VIN), and the auth layer
	// (invalidate any user-existence cache entry for the owning user).
	TopicVehicleDeleted Topic = "vehicle.deleted"

	// TopicShareAccessRevoked is published when an owner action narrows a
	// grantee's vehicle access set while they may hold a live WebSocket —
	// a §7.5.3 revoke or a §7.5.7 suspend. The payload is
	// ShareAccessRevokedEvent. Consumer: the WS hub (close the grantee's
	// sessions for that vehicle with code 4002), which is what closes
	// websocket-protocol.md §10 DV-09 for the share-mutation case.
	//
	// Distinct from TopicVehicleDeleted on purpose. That event says "this
	// car no longer exists" and every consumer — receiver, VIN cache,
	// user-existence cache — has work to do. This one says "this ONE
	// person may no longer look at a car that still exists and is still
	// streaming to its owner", so the hub is the only consumer and the
	// close must be scoped to the grantee. Folding them together would
	// make a suspension tear down the owner's own session.
	TopicShareAccessRevoked Topic = "share.access_revoked"

	// TopicShareAccessWidened is published when an owner action GROWS a
	// grantee's vehicle access set while they may hold a live WebSocket —
	// today only a §7.5.8 extend (MYR-609). The payload is
	// ShareAccessWidenedEvent. Consumer: the WS hub (re-handshake the
	// grantee's sessions), which closes the WIDENING half of
	// websocket-protocol.md §10 DV-09 — recorded there as a benign
	// residual for as long as nothing produced one.
	//
	// A SEPARATE TOPIC FROM TopicShareAccessRevoked, not a `reason` on it,
	// even though the hub does something close to the same thing for both.
	// The two are opposite in the property that matters everywhere else in
	// the system: one is a SECURITY action whose latency is a live GPS leak
	// and which must fail closed, the other is a convenience whose worst
	// outcome is a car appearing a reconnect later. Anything that watches,
	// counts, alerts on, or rate-limits revocations must not have widenings
	// silently folded into its numbers.
	TopicShareAccessWidened Topic = "share.access_widened"

	// TopicVehicleTelemetryWarning is published by the owner-inactivity
	// sweeper on the FOURTH day of an owner's silence, one day before the
	// vehicle's fleet-telemetry config is removed (MYR-592, rest-api.md
	// §7.27). The payload is VehicleTelemetryWarningEvent. Consumer: the
	// push notifier, which sends the OWNER a TRANSACTIONAL alert — an
	// operational account notice about their service, not a subscribable
	// feed, so it is the one push in this service the §7.19 category
	// switches do not reach.
	//
	// Internal-only and never broadcast to WS clients: the client-visible
	// signal is the §7.0 catalog's telemetrySuspendedAt, which only becomes
	// non-null a day later if the owner does not return.
	//
	// There is deliberately NO sibling topic for the suspension itself. The
	// client asked for the in-app notice plus this one warning; a push at
	// the moment of suspension would tell somebody who has not opened the
	// app in five days about a thing they were warned of yesterday.
	TopicVehicleTelemetryWarning Topic = "vehicle.telemetry.warning"
