	// endChargeLevel captured correctly, producing a nonsense "0% -> 75%,
	// -75% used" summary (MYR-207). SOC does not change while parked, so

	// reason (MYR-207, generalised in MYR-629): EnergyRemaining streams at
	// IntervalSeconds: 30 while Gear streams at 1, so the gear-change frame
	// that opens a drive almost never carries energy — and until MYR-629 that
	// left `energyUsedKwh` at a hard 0 on 453 of the last 460 production
	// drives. Energy does not move in a parked car that is not plugged in, so

// watchdog silence, stall, the duration cap, a connectivity drop — leaves
// lastGear at "D" precisely because no gear=P frame was ever seen; that is why
// those end conditions exist. Leaving it set means the first subsequent frame
// that carries any field at all re-enters handleIdle and mints a fresh drive
// for a car that is parked. That was harmless while only the stream produced
// frames (the next stream frame carried a real gear, correcting the cache), but
// REST backfill frames arrive every ~25s during a ride and Tesla answers
// shift_state=null for a parked car, so nothing would ever correct it.

// Clearing to "" is the honest value: we do not know the gear until a frame
