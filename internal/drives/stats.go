// (internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go) — restated in the miles that
// haversine returns.
//
// WHY THIS THRESHOLD EXISTS AT ALL (MYR-394). Before REST position polling, the
// only source of `location` was the stream, and Tesla applied that 10m delta
// filter on the CAR: a parked, streaming vehicle sent gear and speed but not a
// repeated Location, so handleDriving's location branch never ran and the
// MYR-160 stall watchdog could see a motionless drive and close it. A REST
// vehicle_data read has no such filter — it returns the car's cached fix on
// every poll, byte-identical for a car that has not moved. Taking each of those
// as "movement" would refresh lastMovementAt every ~25s forever, so StallTimeout
// could never fire, and an open drive on a parked car would accumulate an
// identical route point (and broadcast a DriveUpdatedEvent) every cycle until
// MaxDriveDuration's 12h backstop. Matching the stream's own delta means the
// two sources agree on what "moved" means.

// previous fix to count as real motion.
//
// A STREAMED frame is taken at face value: Tesla already applied the 10m
// MinimumDelta on the car, so its arrival IS the movement signal, and
// re-deriving the same judgement from sparse GPS here would risk discarding
// genuine points at the boundary. Only the REST-backfilled frames — which carry
