// Fan-out and delivery for the Notifier. Split from notifier.go to keep both
// files inside the 300-line cap.

// delivery is everything about ONE fan-out that is not the copy: who it is for,
// what it is about, and — since MYR-349 — which switch in their Settings turns
// it off. Grouped into a struct because four positional strings at a call site
// is exactly how a topic ends up in the ride-id slot.
type delivery struct {
	// userID is the RECIPIENT — the owner for a new request, the rider for a
	// status change or a due reservation. The preference consulted is theirs,
	// never the other party's.
	userID string
	rideID string
	topic  string
	// category is the preference this notification answers to. Every
	// preference-gated fan-out site must name one; there is no unset value
	// that means "always send" — the ONLY way past the gate is the explicit
	// `transactional` flag below, and fanOut refuses a delivery that claims
	// neither.
	category Category
	// transactional marks an OPERATIONAL ACCOUNT NOTICE rather than a
	// subscribable feed, and it is the one thing that bypasses the §7.19
	// preference gate (MYR-592, rest-api.md §7.19.4).
	//
	// WHY A FLAG AND NOT A SIXTH CATEGORY. A category is a switch, and the
	// premise of a switch is that turning it off is a choice the platform will
	// honour. The day-4 inactivity warning is not that kind of message: it is
	// the platform telling an owner it is about to stop a service they are
	// paying for, one day before it does, and the only alternative channel is
	// an in-app notice they will not see precisely because not opening the app
	// is what triggered it. Minting a `telemetrySuspension` category would have
	// put a toggle on the owner's Settings screen whose honest label is "do not
	// warn me before I lose live telemetry" — a switch nobody wants, that
	// silently defeats the feature, and that §7.19's own framing forbids
	// ("These are DELIVERY preferences, not authorization... A category that is
	// off is a silence").
	//
	// USE IT ONLY FOR NOTICES THAT MEET ALL THREE TESTS: the platform is acting
	// on the account rather than reporting somebody else's action, the recipient
	// can still prevent or reverse it, and no other channel reaches them in
	// time. Ride news fails the first test; a marketing message fails all three.
	// Today this is the only such delivery in the service, and it should stay
	// rare enough to enumerate.
	transactional bool
	// islandAlerts marks a delivery whose news the recipient's Live Activity
	// is ALSO about to deliver, by expanding the Dynamic Island (MYR-413).
	//
	// False is the safe default and the common one: an unset field means "send
	// the banner", so a new fan-out site that forgets this cannot accidentally
	// silence itself. See notifier_activity_gate.go.

	// tripPush is the MYR-602 subject: the trip, the car, the event and the
