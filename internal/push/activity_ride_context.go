	// an instant ride is accepted is streaming genuinely fresh navigation — for
	// a route to the shops. Only the dispatch instant separates a reading that
	// describes the rider's pickup from one that describes whatever the car was
	// already doing. Used by arrivingSoon; see there for the residual bound.
