// ActivityKit remote updates (MYR-172, decisions in MYR-194).
//
// A Live Activity is a widget the rider's phone renders on the lock screen and
// in the Dynamic Island for the length of one ride. The app starts it locally
// when the ride is accepted and hands us a per-Activity push token; from then
// on the SERVER owns what it says, by pushing a new `content-state` to that
// token over APNs.
//
// This is a different push channel from the alerts in notifier.go, not a
// variation on one. It goes to a different topic, carries no alert copy, is
// addressed by a token that rotates mid-ride, and — most importantly — is a
// STATE REPLACEMENT rather than a message: each push overwrites what the Live
// Activity displays, so a lost push costs freshness rather than information.
// That is what makes the staleness policy below safe.

// ActivityEvent is the ActivityKit `aps.event` verb.

	Status string `json:"status"`

	// ETA is the car's arrival time as an ABSOLUTE unix timestamp in seconds,

	// Absolute, not a duration, and that is the whole trick: a duration decays
	// silently on a screen the server cannot repaint ("4 min" stays "4 min" for
	// an hour), whereas an instant stays true no matter how late it is read —
	// the phone subtracts `now` itself and counts down without our help. It is
	// also what lets the tick cadence (24–36s since MYR-573) look continuous.
	//
	// Absent means we genuinely do not know: the car reports no navigation
	// route. There is no server-side route solver in this service, so the

	// MYR-194 rules out in as many words.

	// place the car is driving to, e.g. "Home".
	//
	// On a two-endpoint ride that is the dropoff the rider named when booking,
	// which is all this field ever was before MYR-587. On a multi-stop trip
	// mid-journey it is the STOP the car is currently heading for, because the
	// `eta` beside it always describes the leg the car is driving (MYR-485) and
	// a card pairing the next stop's arrival time with the trip's final place
	// name states something untrue in two lines of true values. See
	// legDestination for the ladder and the statuses it applies to.
	//
	// P1. See data-classification.md §1.18: this is the one field on this
	// surface that the alert-copy policy in copy.go would not permit, and it is
	// carried here deliberately and narrowly — a Live Activity is the rider's
	// own ride on the rider's own device, and a ride card that cannot say where
	// the car is taking you is not the feature. It is never sent to the owner's
	// Activity, and never appears in an alert body.

	// DestinationIsStop says that `destination` names an INTERMEDIATE STOP
	// rather than the trip's final dropoff, omitted entirely when it does not
	// (MYR-587).
	//
	// It exists because the headline and the subline are one sentence: the card
	// reads "{h:mm} dropoff" over "Heading to {destination}", and naming the
	// stop while the noun above it still says "dropoff" would fix half a lie.
	// The word itself stays the CLIENT'S — §7.21.3's rule is that this surface
	// sends the enum and never prose — so what goes on the wire is the
	// discriminator the client cannot compute for itself: stop statuses are
	// server-owned and advance on arrival detection (MYR-538) while the phone is
	// asleep, and the itinerary can be edited mid-ride.
	//
	// P0, on the same test `progress` passes: a boolean saying WHAT KIND of
	// place is already named beside it locates nobody and names nothing.
	//
	// FALSE IS THE ABSENT KEY, and that is what keeps every two-endpoint ride
	// byte-identical to what it sent before this field existed — including
	// every push on `accepted`, `arrived` and every terminal status, which
	// always name the dropoff.

	// Progress is how far along the CURRENT leg the car is, 0..1, omitted

	// Which leg is not carried: `Status` already says it (`accepted` is the car
	// coming to the rider, `enroute` is the car taking them onward), and a
	// second copy of one fact is a second thing that can disagree with itself.
	//
	// P0 and worth saying why, since its neighbour `Destination` is not: this is
	// a unitless fraction of an unnamed journey. It carries no coordinate, no
	// place name, and no distance — "62% of the way" locates the car only for
	// somebody who already knows both ends of the trip, which on this surface is
	// the rider whose trip it is. It is therefore the one field here that could
	// ride an owner-side Activity unchanged, if one is ever started.
	//
	// Absent is a first-class value and the common one: a car with no active nav
	// route, a car whose telemetry has gone quiet, an Activity registered before
	// dispatch. The client renders the card with no track. See
	// activity_progress.go for the derivation and its honesty bounds.

	//
	// OMITTED IS `ride`, permanently rather than transitionally, which is what
	// keeps every ride payload byte-identical to what it was before this field
	// existed and lets a build compiled before v0.41.0 decode a leg's payload
	// unchanged — it renders it as the ride card it already knows, and every
	// field it reads still means what it meant.
	//
	// P0: a two-member enum saying which product surface this card belongs to.
	Kind ActivityKind `json:"kind,omitempty"`

	// TripName is the owner's label for the trip window, present only when Kind
	// is `trip` (MYR-602).
	//
	// Its job is DISAMBIGUATION, which is a real problem on this surface and on
	// no other: a person can be a participant on two trips at once, on two
	// different friends' cars, and "Optimus · Grand Canyon Village" does not say
	// whose road trip that is. A rider has exactly one ride card and never has
	// to ask.
	//
	// P1 USER CONTENT, the same tier and the same handling as `Destination`
	// beside it: sealed at rest on the trip row, carried here narrowly because a
	// Live Activity is addressed by a token scoped to one card on one device,
	// and NEVER in an alert body or a push title — copy_trips.go states that
	// rule and holds it.
	TripName string `json:"tripName,omitempty"`

	// AsOf is when the DATA in this content-state was true, in unix seconds
	// (MYR-398, the v3 card). The client renders it as the stale presentation's
	// subline, "Last updated {h:mm A}".
	//
	// IT IS NOT ActivityNotification.Timestamp, and keeping the two apart is the
	// entire reason the field exists. `aps.timestamp` is when the push was SENT
	// and is what ActivityKit uses to discard an out-of-order update, so it must
	// always be `now`. `AsOf` is when the server last LEARNED something, and it
	// is meant to lag.
	//
	// THE CASE IT EXISTS FOR is the one activity_progress.go's ProgressFreshFor
	// and rest-api.md §7.21.3 already confess to. The ticker pushes
	// unconditionally; the stale-date is `timestamp + 3 min` and is therefore
	// re-armed by the push itself; `eta` is rebuilt from each push's own `now`.
	// So a car that goes quiet mid-leg renders a HELD track beside a
	// perpetually renewed arrival time, ActivityKit never marks the card stale,
	// and nothing on it explains the freeze. This is that missing sentence —
	// which is also exactly why it MUST NOT re-stamp to `now` on a pass that
	// computed nothing new. See contentState for the derivation.
	//
	// Every content-state contentState builds carries one, unlike its two
	// optional neighbours: there is no case in which the server cannot say when
	// it computed a state. It is a POINTER anyway, and that is a deliberate
	// application of `progress`'s own rule rather than symmetry for its own
	// sake — the zero value of an int64 unix timestamp is not a neutral
	// placeholder, it is the claim "this data was true in January 1970", and a
	// card rendering "Last updated 12:00 AM" is worse than one rendering
	// nothing. An absent key is the only safe way for this field to be unset.

// for that ride — every subsequent ETA tick included — not merely the long
