	// deploy — and the fail-fast parse above is exactly the property it needs:

	// whether a car is ever SENT to a pickup, this one whether the server may
	// notice it ARRIVED. False leaves the owner's "Picked up" tap as the only
	// writer of accepted → arrived, which is exactly the pre-MYR-538 behaviour
	// — nothing accumulates while it is off and nothing replays when it comes
	// back on.
	//
	// Same fail-fast parse as its neighbours, and here the argument is at its
	// sharpest: this is the only switch in the file that gates a feature which

	// consumes the `ride.waypoint_arrived` seam only auto-arrival publishes, so
	// turning auto-arrival off silences the flash too, while this switch stops
	// ONLY the flash and leaves the lifecycle write alone.
	//
	// Having its own switch matters precisely because of that asymmetry. This
	// is the one feature in the file that reaches out and MOVES A PHYSICAL CAR
	// on nobody's request; if it ever misfires — a wrong pickup coordinate, a
	// car flashing at 3am outside somebody's bedroom — the operator must be
	// able to stop the lights without also giving up the arrival detection that

	// must be able to stop without a deploy.
	//
	// IT IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL SWITCH IN THIS FILE, and the asymmetry is
	// worth stating. Turning it OFF stops NEW suspensions and un-suspends
	// NOTHING: a car whose config is already gone at Tesla stays silent until
	// its owner presses reconnect, because the config lives at Tesla and no
	// flag here reaches it. So this is a brake, never a reverse gear — if a
	// batch of cars was wrongly suspended, flipping this stops the bleeding and
	// the repair is a fleet-config push per car, not a redeploy.
	//
	// Turning it off also has a cost with no alarm attached: the platform
	// quietly resumes paying Tesla for every idle car, and nothing in the
	// product looks wrong. Watch the sweep's own log line while it is off.
