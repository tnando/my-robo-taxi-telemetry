// Package wserrors holds the typed error-code catalog and the REST

// Both internal/ws/ and internal/telemetry/ depend on this package; it
// depends on no other internal package, which is what lets the WS and
// REST layers share the catalog without forming an import cycle.

// ErrorCode is the closed enum of typed error codes the server returns
// to SDK clients on both the WebSocket `error` frame
// (websocket-protocol.md §6.1.1) and the REST `error.code` envelope
// field (rest-api.md §4.1.1). Per FR-7.1, SDK consumers branch on the
// typed code, never on the human-readable `message`.
//
// The catalog below is the single source of truth for the server's
// emission surface. Adding a new code requires updating, in the same
// PR: this enum, the catalog tables in websocket-protocol.md §6.1.1
// and rest-api.md §4.1.1, the JSON Schema enum at
// schemas/ws-messages.schema.json `ErrorPayload.code`, and the
// reachability test in internal/wserrors/wserrors_test.go.
//
// Function signatures across the codebase (sendError, writeError,
// WriteErrorEnvelope) take ErrorCode rather than `string`, so the
// compiler enforces that every error construction site pulls a value
// from this enum — there is no string-literal-at-call-site path.
