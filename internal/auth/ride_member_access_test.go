// MYR-540 — GROUP-RIDE MEMBERSHIP as the third source of vehicle access.
//
// The SQL half (the access-set UNION leg and its status predicate) is pinned by
// the store's integration tests; what is pinned here is the resolution: which
// TIER a member gets, where membership sits in the precedence order, and which
// way each failure resolves.
//
// MYR-602 REVERSED THE PRECEDENCE AND RENAMED THE TIER, and both changes are
// recorded in the cases below rather than papered over.
//
//   - The tier is now RoleRideMember, not RoleViewer. MYR-602 narrowed
//     RoleViewer (a standing share no longer carries live location), so a
//     riding member resolving as a viewer would have LOST the map mid-ride.
//     RoleRideMember's field set is byte-for-byte the pre-MYR-602 viewer set,
//     which is what makes ride tracking unchanged.
//   - The elevated probes now run BEFORE the share is allowed to answer. Every
//     trip participant is by construction also a share-holder, so resolving
//     the share first would have returned RoleViewer for all of them and the
//     window would have granted nothing. The CAPABILITY concern the old
//     ordering protected is preserved differently and better: the grant is
//     read first and returned ALONGSIDE the elevated role, so a `rides`
//     share-holder who is also riding keeps allow_rides — see the case below,
//     which now asserts exactly that.

// stubRideMembership answers the per-vehicle membership probe.
