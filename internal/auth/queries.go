// Every SQL statement the authenticator issues, in one file so the whole
// authorization-relevant statement set can be read at once. Each WHERE clause
// here is an access-control decision, and two of them changed in MYR-369 — see
// the per-statement notes.

// queryUserVehicleIDs fetches the caller's full VEHICLE ACCESS SET — the
// vehicles they own, UNIONed with the vehicles somebody has shared with them
// (MYR-91 viewer merge / MYR-184 sharing), the vehicle of a live group ride
// they joined (MYR-540) and the vehicle of an open trip window they are a
// participant of (MYR-602).
//
// Before MYR-184 the access set was ownership alone, which is why the `viewer`
// role existed in the mask matrix without a single row that could produce it.
// The second leg is what makes it real: an accepted go_vehicle_shares grant
// (Go-owned, migration 0020) puts the vehicle in the grantee's set, so it flows
// through EVERY consumer of this query at once — the WebSocket subscribed set,
// GET /api/vehicles, and every per-vehicle handler that asks "can this caller
// see this car".
//
// Revoked and pending rows are excluded by the `status = 'accepted'` predicate:
// an invite that was never redeemed grants nothing, and revocation is a
// tombstone flip, so a revoked grant drops out of the set on the next lookup.
// UNION (not UNION ALL) de-duplicates the case where an owner also holds a
// stale grant row for their own car.
//
// SUSPENDED GRANTS ARE EXCLUDED TOO (MYR-369, `suspended_at IS NULL`), and THIS
// IS THE PREDICATE THAT MAKES SUSPENSION MEAN ANYTHING. Suspension is specified
// as gating EVERYTHING — catalog row, REST snapshot, WebSocket subscription,
// drives, rides — and rather than adding five independent checks it is enforced
// once, here, in the one query every one of those surfaces resolves through.
// A suspended viewer's answer to "can this caller see this car" becomes plain
// no, identical to a stranger's, which is exactly the intended semantics: the
// grant row survives so the owner can lift the suspension, and conveys nothing
// while it stands.
//
// Note this is a NARROWING of the access set, so the failure direction if the
// predicate were ever dropped is over-exposure, not breakage — which is why it
// carries a test of its own rather than relying on a surface-level assertion
// noticing.
// A THIRD LEG LANDED IN MYR-540: the vehicle of a LIVE GROUP RIDE the caller
// has JOINED. A member is riding in the car, so they see it exactly as the
// requester does — and, like the requester, only for the ride's lifetime.
//
// It is the narrowest of the three legs by construction and each narrowing is
// deliberate:
//
//   - RIDE-SCOPED, not vehicle-scoped. The membership row is the whole grant;
//     there is no standing entry on the car, so there is nothing to revoke
//     afterwards and no residue for an owner to discover months later.
//   - LIVE ONLY. The terminal statuses are excluded here, in the statement, so
//     access ENDS when the ride does with no sweep, no expiry job and no
//     revocation call. This is the same shape as `suspended_at IS NULL` above:
//     an access-control predicate placed in the one query every surface
//     resolves through, rather than five independent checks.
//   - VIEWER TIER. Membership only puts the vehicle IN the set. What the member
//     may then see is decided by ResolveVehicleAccess, which resolves them to
//     RoleViewer with the zero-value (most restrictive) capability set — so a
//     member cannot request rides in the car on the strength of riding in it.
//
// Note the failure direction if this leg were ever dropped: a member's app goes
// dark mid-ride. If it were ever WIDENED (say, by losing the status filter), a
// stranger keeps live GPS on somebody's car forever. The status predicate is the
// one that carries the risk, and it has a test of its own.
// A FOURTH LEG LANDED IN MYR-602: the vehicle of a trip whose WINDOW IS OPEN
// RIGHT NOW and on which the caller is a live participant.
//
// It is the closest sibling of leg 3 and differs in exactly one way that
// matters: a ride ends when a status changes, whereas a trip ends when the
// CLOCK passes an instant. Nothing writes a row at that moment, so there is no
// mutation for the revocation nudge to hang off and the 60-second
// AccessRevalidator sweep is the enforcement — see internal/ws/
// access_revalidator.go, which MYR-602 also taught to re-mask rather than only
// to kick.
//
// THREE PREDICATES, EACH LOAD-BEARING:
//
//   - THE WINDOW: `starts_at <= NOW() AND NOW() < COALESCE(ended_at, ends_at)`,
//     half-open, matching store.Trip.StatusAt exactly. COALESCE is what makes
//     the owner's early end take effect here with no second column to read.
//     ACCESS IS PURELY THE WINDOW (client ruling, 2026-09-05): it is not
//     conditioned on a leg being underway, on the car's status, or on a
//     destination being set. A parked car with no route inside an open window
//     streams to its participants, exactly as it does to its owner.
//   - THE MEMBERSHIP: `left_at IS NULL`. A participant who left, or whom the
//     owner removed, drops out on the next lookup with nothing to sweep.
//   - THE SHARE JOIN: the participant must STILL hold a live accepted,
//     unsuspended grant on that same car. This is what makes "trip access can
//     never outlive the share" structural rather than a cleanup job. Note it
//     carries the same `status = 'accepted' AND suspended_at IS NULL` pair as
//     leg 2 — the sixth copy of the suspension predicate catalogued in
//     internal/store/vehicle_share_access_queries.go.
//
// Failure direction if this leg were dropped: a participant's map goes dark
// mid-trip. If it were widened by losing the window, a person keeps live GPS on
// somebody's car forever — so the window predicate carries the risk, and it has
// a test of its own.
