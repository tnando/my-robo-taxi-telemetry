// adapter exists so the handlers stay decoupled from internal/store.
//
// GetByID returns the wide read with GPS dual-resolution and
// nav-route blob decryption already applied per
// vehicle_repo_scan.go — exactly what /snapshot needs. The drives
// handler reuses this for the ownership check (it needs the userID
// off the row; GetByID is the cheapest source of truth for an
// arbitrary vehicleId cuid).

// without a database: MYR-320 shipped trim_label / fsd_version through the
// migration, the writer, the SELECT, the scan, the response struct AND the mask
// table, and they still came back null in production because this one struct
// literal never learned them. Every other layer had a test; this projection did
// not. See adapters_vehicle_snapshot_test.go, which asserts EVERY field of the
// destination row is populated from a fully-populated source vehicle so the
// next column added to the side table cannot repeat the same silent drop.
