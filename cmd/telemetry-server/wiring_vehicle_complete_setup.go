// MYR-505 zero-touch setup completion wiring:
// POST /api/tesla/vehicles/{vehicleId}/complete-setup (rest-api.md §7.23).
//
// TWO CLIENTS, THE SAME SPLIT THE RECONCILER USES. `wake_up` and
// `fleet_status` are UNSIGNED authenticated reads and go to the DIRECT Fleet
// API; the config push is the only signed call and it goes through the
// tesla-http-proxy — inside MYR-489's own code, which is why nothing here
// builds a writer client at all. Sending either kind to the other's base URL
// fails, so the split is wired once, here, and never restated downstream.
//
// THE ROUTE IS ALWAYS MOUNTED, deliberately, even when the reconciler is off.
// A 404 would tell an SDK the server is too old to complete setup; what is
// actually true on a proxy-less deployment is that pairing can still be
// CHECKED (both probes are unsigned) and only the push is unavailable. So the
// endpoint answers `awaiting_virtual_key` / `streaming` / `token_failed`
// normally and returns a typed `503 service_unavailable` on the one path that
// needs the signer. This is the same reasoning setupVehicleRefreshEndpoint
// gives for always mounting §7.15.
