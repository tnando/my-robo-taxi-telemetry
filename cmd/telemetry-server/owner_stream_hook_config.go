// pushConfig performs the link-time fleet-config push and returns the
// go_fleet_config_attempts.last_outcome label that describes what happened,
// plus whether the push APPLIED.
//
// SetupOutcomeNone (” — no claim) covers the three cases where there is
// nothing to say about this car yet: no signing proxy is configured, the VIN is
// not pushable, or the push APPLIED. The last one is the important one to read
// as "no claim" rather than as success-with-a-row: a config Tesla accepted is
// not evidence of anything the owner has to finish, and the wire derivation
// treats it accordingly.
//
// THE `applied` RETURN EXISTS BECAUSE THOSE THREE CASES ARE NOT THE SAME EVENT
// (MYR-529), even though they write the same label. Tesla applies a
// fleet-telemetry config only to a VIN whose virtual key is enrolled — an
// unpaired car is exactly what comes back as `missing_key` — so a link-time
// push that applied is PROOF OF PAIRING arriving at the earliest door there is.
// It used to be indistinguishable from "we did not push at all", so the one
// door that could have started the clock at second zero stayed silent.

//
// WHY IT RUNS FOR EVERY OUTCOME AND NOT JUST `missing_key`. MYR-491 wrote this
// row only when Tesla answered the push with a missing virtual key, on the
// reading that any other answer meant there was nothing to record. Prod
// disagreed: Spencer White's car (linked 18:07:47Z on 2026-08-09) has no row at
// all, so nothing that keys off the row could see it — the in-band pairing
// signal no-opped when he finally sent a command, and the MYR-491 card had
// nothing to render while he sat watching a silent car. A row costs one
// bounded INSERT per provisioned vehicle and is scheduling- and wire-identical
// to no row; not having one costs the whole self-heal machinery its handle.
