// setupVehicleSharingEndpoints mounts the MYR-184 vehicle-sharing surface
// (rest-api.md §7.5) — four owner routes and one rider route:
//
//	POST   /api/vehicles/{vehicleId}/invites
//	GET    /api/vehicles/{vehicleId}/invites
//	DELETE /api/invites/{inviteId}
//	PATCH  /api/invites/{inviteId}
//	POST   /api/invites/{inviteId}/resend
//	POST   /api/vehicles/{vehicleId}/share/extend
//	POST   /api/invites/redeem
//
// ROUTE ORDERING NOTE: `/api/invites/redeem` and `/api/invites/{inviteId}` do
// not collide — they differ in method (POST vs DELETE) — but
// `/api/invites/{inviteId}/resend` and `/api/invites/redeem` are both POST
// under /api/invites/. Go's ServeMux gives the literal segment precedence over
// the wildcard, and the two patterns have different segment counts anyway, so
// both resolve unambiguously. This is the same precedence the MYR-175
// /api/ride-requests/incoming route relies on.
//
// The authenticator is passed as the cache invalidator: redeeming busts the
// REDEEMER's cached access set so the car appears immediately, revoking busts
// the REVOKED VIEWER's so access ends immediately rather than at the next TTL
// lapse, and PATCH busts the GRANTEE's (MYR-369) — a suspension removes the
// vehicle from that person's access set, so it is a revoke in every respect that
// matters to the cache. See auth.JWTAuthenticator.InvalidateVehicles for the
// single-instance caveat.
