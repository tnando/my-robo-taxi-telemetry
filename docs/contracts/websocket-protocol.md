# WebSocket Protocol Contract

**Status:** Draft -- v1
**Target artifact:** AsyncAPI 3.0 specification at [`specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml`](specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml)
**Owner:** `sdk-architect` agent
**Last updated:** 2026-04-13

## Purpose

Defines every WebSocket message exchanged between the telemetry server (`internal/ws/`) and SDK clients (TypeScript, Swift, web, mobile). This contract is the authoritative source for:

- The connection handshake (auth frame, token validation, accept/reject)
- Server->client and client->server message catalogs
- The envelope schema (type discriminator, payload, planned sequence/timestamp)
- Heartbeat cadence and close-code semantics
- Reconnection and snapshot-resume rules

The markdown is the human source of truth. Its machine-readable twin is [`specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml`](specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml). Per-message JSON Schemas live alongside in [`schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json) and [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json). Drift between this doc, the AsyncAPI spec, the schemas, and `internal/ws/` is a CI failure ([`contract-guard`](../../CLAUDE.md#merge-policy-non-negotiable)).

Known, **accepted** divergences between this contract and the current `internal/ws/` implementation are catalogued in §10. Every such entry has a Linear follow-up title. A divergence that is not listed in §10 is contract drift and MUST be fixed, not added.

## Anchored requirements

Every FR/NFR listed here is anchored in at least one section of this doc. The tag in the "Where" column is the exact section the requirement lands in.

| ID | Requirement | Where it lands |

| Path | `/api/ws` | [`internal/ws/handler.go`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 43 |
| Production scheme | `wss://` (TLS termination at the edge, **NFR-3.22**) | Fly.io edge |
| Local dev scheme | `ws://` (allowed only when origin matches dev allow-list) | [`cmd/telemetry-server/main.go`](../../cmd/telemetry-server/main.go) |
| HTTP method | `GET` (with `Upgrade: websocket` header) | RFC 6455 §4 |
| Content type | `application/json`, framed as WebSocket text messages | [`internal/ws/client.go:writeMessage`](../../internal/ws/client.go) |
| WebSocket library | [`github.com/coder/websocket`](https://github.com/coder/websocket) (never `gorilla/websocket`, per `CLAUDE.md`) | [`internal/ws/handler.go`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 13 |

### 1.2 Origin enforcement

The server passes `HandlerConfig.OriginPatterns` (populated from `WebSocketConfig.AllowedOrigins`) to `websocket.AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns`. Requests from origins not in the allow-list are rejected with `HTTP 403` **before** the WebSocket upgrade completes. There is no in-band error frame for this case -- the client receives an HTTP error response on the upgrade attempt; the server logs a `slog.Warn` with the rejected `Origin`, the `remote_addr`, and the request `host` so an operator chasing "why is my browser blocked?" sees the failure inline.

The allow-list resolves at startup per [`cmd/telemetry-server/adapters.go:resolveWSOriginPatterns`](../../cmd/telemetry-server/adapters.go) — operator-configured patterns always take precedence; the dev/prod split only governs the empty-config fallback (per NFR-3.22 and MYR-17):

| Mode | When `AllowedOrigins` is set | Empty-config fallback |
|------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Production (no `--dev`) | Use the configured slice verbatim. Production ships `["https://myrobotaxi.app", "https://www.myrobotaxi.app"]` in [`configs/fly.json`](../../configs/fly.json). | Empty slice — **fail-closed**. `coder/websocket` admits same-origin and empty-`Origin` requests; every cross-origin dial is rejected with HTTP 403. A `slog.Warn` at startup reminds the operator to set `websocket.allowed_origins` or `WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. |
| Dev (`--dev` flag) | Use the configured slice verbatim. | Localhost defaults: `localhost`, `localhost:*`, `127.0.0.1`, `127.0.0.1:*`, `[::1]`, `[::1]:*` (any scheme, any port). |

`WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is the env-var override for `websocket.allowed_origins`. It accepts a comma-separated list (whitespace around each entry is trimmed; entirely-empty input signals fail-closed). The env var, when set, fully replaces the JSON-config allow-list rather than appending to it.

Pattern matching follows the `coder/websocket` `authenticateOrigin` rules: a pattern containing `://` is matched against `<scheme>://<host>` of the `Origin` header (so `https://myrobotaxi.app` rejects an `http://myrobotaxi.app` Origin); a pattern without `://` is matched against `<host>` only (so `localhost:*` admits any scheme on any port). Patterns use `path.Match` glob semantics — `*.myrobotaxi.app` admits one subdomain level. Same-origin requests (Origin host == request host) and requests without an `Origin` header are always admitted.

Operator escape hatches for non-localhost dev workflows: `WEBSOCKET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://*.ngrok.io` admits ngrok tunnels; `https://*.trycloudflare.com` admits Cloudflare tunnels. The env var fully replaces the JSON-config allow-list so the operator must include any other origins (e.g. `https://*.ngrok.io,https://myrobotaxi.app`) in the same value.

### 1.3 Connection limits

v1 enforces **two** concurrent-connection caps with asymmetric policies:

| Cap | Default | Enforcement point | Breach response | Surfaced as |
|-----|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Per-IP (`HandlerConfig.MaxConnectionsPerIP`) | **64** | Pre-auth, during the HTTP upgrade | `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` (no WS handshake, no `error` frame) | HTTP status on upgrade -> SDK treats as `rate_limited` per §6.1.1 |
| Per-user (`WebSocketConfig.MaxConnectionsPerUser`) | **5** ([`internal/config/defaults.go:67`](../../internal/config/defaults.go)) | Post-auth, after `Authenticator.ValidateToken` succeeds, before `Hub.Register` | `error` frame (`code: "rate_limited"`) followed by WS close code **`4003 Server Overload`** | `error.code = "rate_limited"` + close code 4003 per §6.1.1 / §6.2 |

**Rationale.** The per-IP cap at the upgrade layer survives corporate / campus / carrier NAT (a shared egress IP is common) while still deterring single-host floods. The per-user cap prevents a compromised token from hoarding every slot in the hub; 5 concurrent sessions is enough for a user with phone + desktop + watch + tablet + a debug session without giving an attacker unbounded leverage. The per-IP cap is deliberately higher than the per-user cap because one IP routinely aggregates many legitimate users.

**Close-code choice.** Per-user breaches close with **4003 Server Overload** (reserved in §6.2) because the user IS entitled to *some* session -- they are being shed for overload-management reasons, and the SDK should auto-reconnect with extended backoff after shedding the excess. By contrast, a per-IP breach never reaches the WebSocket layer, so there is no 4xxx code to send -- the SDK observes the HTTP 429 and falls into the §7.1 reconnect backoff.

The client IP is resolved from the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` entry when present ([`internal/ws/handler.go:resolveClientIP`](../../internal/ws/handler.go)); `hub.ipConnectionCount` provides the per-IP counter and `Hub.Register` tracks per-user state.

> **Divergence (DV-08):** The target behavior above is the v1 contract. Today, [`cmd/telemetry-server/main.go`](../../cmd/telemetry-server/main.go) line 178 builds the `HandlerConfig` without populating `MaxConnectionsPerIP`, and `WebSocketConfig.MaxConnectionsPerUser` is likewise not threaded into the handler, so **neither cap is enforced yet**. The resolution is a wiring change (not a design change); tracked as DV-08 in §10.
>
> **Divergence (DV-14):** Neither cap defends against a slow-auth attack where each TCP connection sits under the per-IP cap but holds the 5 s `AuthTimeout` window. Mitigation is deferred to a follow-up: either a dedicated pre-auth rate-limit on upgrade *attempts* (not just concurrent holdings) OR a shortened `AuthTimeout` under load. Tracked as DV-14 in §10.

SDKs MUST treat both HTTP 429 on upgrade AND WebSocket close code 4003 as `rate_limited` signals, apply the reconnect backoff from §7.1 (with extended ceiling for 4003 per §6.2), and surface `rate_limited` as a typed error per FR-7.1.

```

Implementation: [`internal/ws/handler.go:handleUpgrade`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) -> `authenticateClient`.

### 2.2 Auth frame requirements

1. **First frame.** The client MUST send the auth frame as its FIRST WebSocket frame after the upgrade. Any other `type` value before auth is treated as an auth failure ([`handler.go:authenticateClient`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 136: `if msg.Type != msgTypeAuth { return error }`).
2. **No `Authorization` header.** The token MUST NOT be sent as an HTTP header on the upgrade request. Browsers cannot set arbitrary headers on the WebSocket upgrade, so the in-band frame is the only portable channel. Native clients MAY send a duplicate header for defense in depth, but the server ignores it.
3. **Deadline.** The server enforces a 5-second deadline for the auth frame (`HandlerConfig.AuthTimeout`, default `5*time.Second` from `applyHandlerDefaults`). Exceeding the deadline produces error code `auth_timeout` followed by close code 1008.
4. **Token format.** Opaque to the WebSocket layer. The configured `Authenticator` ([`internal/ws/auth.go`](../../internal/ws/auth.go)) validates it. Production uses `internal/auth.NewJWTAuthenticator` (checks signature, issuer, audience, expiry against `AuthConfig`). Dev uses `ws.NoopAuthenticator`, which accepts any non-empty token and returns the configured `VehicleIDs`.
5. **Vehicle resolution.** On a valid token the server calls `Authenticator.GetUserVehicles(ctx, userID)` and stores the resulting vehicle IDs on the `Client` struct ([`client.go:Client.vehicleIDs`](../../internal/ws/client.go)). The set is a snapshot of ownership at handshake time; per-broadcast ownership filtering uses this snapshot (§4.5). The snapshot is never narrowed in place — when access is lost mid-connection the server **ends the session** with close `4002` and lets the reconnect re-run this step (§4.5.1), which is what closes DV-09 for the loss direction.
6. **Token redaction.** The token is **P1** per [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §1.2 (`AuthPayload.token`). It MUST NOT appear in any structured log, error message, metric label, or crash report. The server logs only the resolved `userID` (P0) and `vehicle_count` (P0) -- see [`hub.go:Hub.Register`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 40.

### 2.3 Auth result envelope

v1 requires the server to emit a **positive** acknowledgement frame, `auth_ok`, as the FIRST frame the client receives after a successful handshake. Its purpose is to give the SDK a deterministic transition out of `connecting` without having to wait for telemetry traffic -- which on idle vehicles may not arrive for up to one heartbeat interval (default 15 s, §7.4) and on a cold watchOS wake is the entire session.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "auth_ok",
  "payload": {
    "userId":       "clxyz1234567890userid",
    "vehicleCount": 3,
    "issuedAt":     "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `userId` | `string` (cuid) | **P1** | Echoed back from the token-resolved `userID`. Lets the SDK sanity-check ownership set on reconnect (e.g., compare against a cached user ID). |
| `vehicleCount` | `integer` | **P1** | Size of the user's vehicle set at handshake time. Gives the SDK a quick integrity check against its cached snapshot. |
| `issuedAt` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P2** | Server's `time.Now().UTC()` at the moment `Hub.Register` succeeded. Debug-only. |

SDK handling:

1. On receipt of `auth_ok`, the SDK transitions `connectionState`: `connecting -> connected` (state-machine.md C-3; C-3 is the single transition that flips `connectionState` from `connecting` to `connected` -- see [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3). This is the canonical trigger for C-3 -- the SDK MUST NOT use "first data frame" or "first heartbeat" as the trigger. DV-15 RESOLVED: `state-machine.md` §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED`, aligned by MYR-31.
2. If the `userId` field does not match a previously-cached user ID for this consumer, the SDK SHOULD surface this as a warning and clear any per-user cache that may contain values from the wrong account. This is a defense against token mix-up bugs in consumer code, not a server-side issue.
3. `vehicleCount` is informational; the authoritative ownership set is populated on the next REST snapshot fetch (§7.2).
4. **Pre-`auth_ok` liveness bound.** The SDK MUST bound its wait for `auth_ok` with a local timer of **6 seconds** (1-second grace over the server's 5-second `HandlerConfig.AuthTimeout`, to absorb one-way network latency). The timer starts the moment the `auth` frame has been handed to the socket (i.e., alongside C-1 `initializing -> connecting`). If `auth_ok` has not arrived AND no `error` frame has arrived AND the WebSocket has not closed within this window, the SDK MUST treat this as a silent handshake failure: close the socket locally with code 1001 and transition `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) with a typed reason of `auth_timeout`. This bounds the "Connecting..." UI state on degraded paths (e.g., upgrade succeeded but the server stalled post-`Hub.Register`). Without this bound the only fallback is the §7.4.1 liveness watchdog, which does not start until the first frame arrives and therefore cannot cover the pre-`auth_ok` window. The liveness watchdog (§7.4.1) is a separate, post-`auth_ok` mechanism.

The server **also** sends an explicit error frame on failure (§6.1) followed by a close frame with code 1008. Failure and success paths are mutually exclusive -- the client either sees `auth_ok` (success) or an `error` frame followed by close 1008 (failure) or the SDK pre-`auth_ok` timer expires (silent failure), never more than one.

> **ONE frame, and its `message` is a static string ([MYR-612](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-612)).** The server used to write TWO error frames on some refusals — one from `authenticateClient` and a second from `handleUpgrade` carrying the whole wrapped Go error chain, resolved user id included, which §6.3 and Rule CG-DC-2 forbid. Refusals are emitted from exactly one place now (`handler.go:refuseHandshake`) with the fixed messages `"invalid token"` and `"auth frame not received"`.
>
> **THE ONE REFUSAL THAT CARRIES NO FRAME AT ALL** is an existence probe that could not be ANSWERED (§2.4). `service_unavailable` is deliberately absent from `ErrorPayload.code`, so the server closes with **`1013` Try Again Later** and writes nothing (§6.2). An SDK MUST therefore treat a 1013 close during `connecting` as a transient refusal in its own right and not wait for a frame that is never coming.

> **Note on DV-07:** `auth_ok` is v1-required (pulled out of DV-07 in MYR-33). The control-frame portion of DV-07 — `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` / `ping` / `pong` plus the typed `vehicle_not_owned` error and close code 4002 — is RESOLVED by MYR-46. The `sinceSeq` snapshot-resume sub-row remains open under DV-02 (envelope sequence numbers).

### 2.4 Connection state mapping

The handshake drives the following [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 transitions:

| Wire event | `connectionState` transition | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| HTTP 101 + outbound `auth` frame | `initializing -> connecting` (C-1) | Token in flight |
| Receipt of `auth_ok` frame | `connecting -> connected` (C-3) | Canonical trigger. Reset retry counter; start SDK liveness watchdog (§7.4.1). DV-15 RESOLVED: [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED`, aligned by MYR-31. |
| SDK pre-`auth_ok` timer expires (6 s, §2.3 rule 4) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Bounds the "Connecting..." UI state on degraded paths (post-upgrade stall, dropped `auth_ok` in flight). Surface as typed `auth_timeout`; auto-retry with backoff. Independent of the post-`auth_ok` liveness watchdog (§7.4.1). |
| `Authenticator.ValidateToken` returns error | `connecting -> error` (C-5 terminal if `auth_failed`) | Surface `auth_failed` typed error; no auto-retry |
| `Authenticator.ValidateToken` could not ANSWER the fail-closed user-existence probe (pool wait, statement timeout, a cancelled peer sharing the coalesced lookup) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | **Close code `1013` Try Again Later, with NO error frame ([MYR-612](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-612)).** The handshake is still refused — the check stays fail-closed — but the credential is not implicated, so a client must **auto-retry with backoff rather than burn its refresh and fall back to a sign-in screen.** `auth_failed` is the one close a client is entitled to act on destructively, and a database hiccup is not grounds for it. **There is deliberately no typed frame:** `service_unavailable` is not a member of `ErrorPayload.code` (§6.1.1, [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) §4.1.1.a) because the WS analogue of a 503 is a close code, and adding the member would be a breaking decode on every shipped SDK. Mirrors [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) §3.2.1, which maps the same condition to `503` |
| Auth deadline exceeded (`ErrAuthTimeout`) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Surface `auth_timeout`; auto-retry with backoff. See DV-06. |
| Per-user cap breach (close code 4003) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Surface `rate_limited`; auto-retry with extended backoff. See DV-08. |
| HTTP 429 on upgrade (per-IP cap) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Surface `rate_limited`; apply reconnect backoff. See DV-08. |
| HTTP 403 on upgrade (origin) | `connecting -> error` (C-5 terminal) | Consumer must fix origin config |

The transition IDs (C-1..C-5) are defined in [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3.

> **Divergence (DV-15): RESOLVED.** The authoritative C-3 trigger is receipt of `auth_ok` (this doc's §2.3). [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED`, aligned by MYR-31. Both docs agree on the canonical trigger. See §10 DV-15 for the audit trail.

### 3.1 Wire shape

Every frame is a JSON object with the following top-level keys:

```jsonc

  "type": "vehicle_update",   // string discriminator (required)
  "payload": { ... },         // type-specific object (omitted on bare control frames)
  "seq":  42,                 // PLANNED: monotonic per-connection sequence (DV-02)
  "ts":   "2026-04-13T18:22:01Z" // PLANNED: server-authoritative envelope timestamp (DV-02)
}
```

|-------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `type` | YES | both | Discriminator. See §4 (server->client) and §5 (client->server) for the catalog. Enumerated in [`ws-envelope.schema.json#/properties/type/enum`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json). |
| `payload` | Per-type | both | Type-specific object. Omitted on `heartbeat` ([`messages.go:wsMessage.Payload`](../../internal/ws/messages.go) uses `json:"payload,omitempty"` and [`heartbeat.go`](../../internal/ws/heartbeat.go) marshals the bare envelope once at init). |
| `seq` | NO (PLANNED) | server->client | Monotonic per-connection sequence number. NOT currently emitted -- see DV-02. |
| `ts` | NO (PLANNED) | server->client | Server-authoritative ISO 8601 UTC envelope timestamp. NOT currently emitted -- see DV-02. Today, `vehicle_update.payload.timestamp`, `drive_started.payload.timestamp`, etc. carry the same information at the payload level. |

The Go struct that produces this envelope is [`internal/ws/messages.go:wsMessage`](../../internal/ws/messages.go):

```go
type wsMessage struct {
    Type    string          `json:"type"`
    Payload json.RawMessage `json:"payload,omitempty"`
}
```

**Open-object rule (FR-1.3).** All SDK parsers MUST treat the envelope and every payload as open objects: unknown keys are permitted at both levels and MUST be ignored silently. This gives us forward compatibility for new fields without a breaking wire change when FR-1.3 is exercised (extensibility as pattern). Strictness is enforced at validation time by JSON Schema / contract-tester fixtures, not at parse time in the SDK hot path.

> **Note on `additionalProperties: false` in the JSON Schemas.** Both [`ws-envelope.schema.json`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json) and [`ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json) set `additionalProperties: false` at every level. This is the **`contract-tester` invariant** -- it asserts that every fixture and every captured wire frame validated in CI contains ONLY the fields declared in this contract. It is NOT a runtime SDK requirement: the SDK hot path MUST remain permissive (ignore unknown keys, never throw on extras). Put differently, the schemas' `additionalProperties: false` means "if this frame reaches a conformance test, it MUST be exactly this shape"; the open-object rule means "if this frame reaches an SDK parser, extras MUST be tolerated." The two rules coexist because contract-tester catches drift at PR time while the SDK ships to production built against whichever schema was canonical when it was generated -- and that schema might be older than what the server emits.

### 3.2 Atomic-group rule (NFR-3.1)

A single `vehicle_update` frame's `payload.fields` map MUST contain members of **at most one** atomic group, plus any number of individually-delivered (ungrouped) fields. The atomic groups are declared in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §2 and reproduced here for wire-level clarity:

| Group | Members (wire field names) | Classification summary |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| `navigation` | `destinationName`, `destinationAddress`, `destinationLatitude`, `destinationLongitude`, `originLatitude`, `originLongitude`, `etaMinutes`, `tripDistanceRemaining`, `navRouteCoordinates` | Mixed -- see §4.1.2 |
| `charge` | `chargeLevel`, `chargeState`, `estimatedRange`, `timeToFull` | All **P0** |
| `gps` | `latitude`, `longitude`, `heading` | `lat`/`lng` **P1** (encrypted at rest), `heading` **P0** |
| `gear` | `gearPosition`, `status` | All **P0** |
| `drive` | `startedAt` (carried via `drive_started.payload.startedAt`) | **P0**. This is the v1 home of `tripStartTime` per DV-13. The drive group is not a `vehicle_update.fields` group; it is delivered via the `drive_started` lifecycle message (§4.2) and is never interleaved with telemetry frames. |

`destinationAddress` is nullable on the wire (Prisma `String?`). It is a full member of the navigation atomic group and participates in the active-navigation predicate as of MYR-24 (2026-04-23); the prior spec-only exemption in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §3.1 has been retired.

Ungrouped fields (delivered individually, no group membership): `speed`, `odometerMiles`, `interiorTemp`, `exteriorTemp`, `fsdMilesSinceReset`, `locationName`, `locationAddress`, `lastUpdated`, the MYR-252 cabin-control read-back fields (`locked`, `hvacPower`, `isClimateOn`, `fanSpeed`, `driverTempSetting`, `passengerTempSetting`, `hvacAutoMode`, `hvacAcEnabled`, `seatHeaterLeft`/`Right`, `seatHeaterRearLeft`/`Center`/`Right`, `seatCoolerLeft`/`Right`, `seatVentEnabled`, `chargePortDoorOpen`, `frunkOpen`, `trunkOpen`, `mediaPlaybackStatus`, `mediaVolume` — see §4.1.7), and the drive-only `driveTrailCoordinates` field (§4.1.6). Their classification tiers are defined in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §1.1.

**Server enforcement** ([`internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go:handleTelemetry`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go)):

1. For each incoming telemetry event, fields are partitioned by atomic group using [`groupOf`](../../internal/ws/atomic_groups.go) (the single source of truth for group membership, per [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §1.1). Navigation-group fields are split off; everything else (charge / gps / gear / individual) is treated uniformly as immediate-broadcast.
2. Navigation-group fields are added to the `groupAccumulator` ([`internal/ws/group_accumulator.go`](../../internal/ws/group_accumulator.go)), which merges them over a 500 ms flush window per `(group, VIN)` slot and flushes a single `vehicle_update` per slot via `flushGroup` ([`internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go:flushGroup`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go)). In v1 only `groupNavigation` registers an accumulator slot; the accumulator is generalized over groupID so a future MYR can opt charge or another group in.
3. Non-nav fields broadcast immediately via a separate `vehicle_update` frame from `handleTelemetry`.

The result is that a single frame never carries members from two different atomic groups. SDKs MUST validate this rule on receipt and treat a frame carrying fields from more than one atomic group as a contract violation (log it and discard the foreign-group fields; do not crash).

**Atomic groups that do NOT map to a dedicated wire accumulator:** `charge`, `gps`, and `gear`. The server delivers these groups' fields in one `vehicle_update` **iff** Tesla emits the members within a single upstream telemetry batch -- concretely, a Tesla `Payload` protobuf message with a `data[]` array of `Datum` entries covering those fields (see the [`tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme`](../../.claude/skills/tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme/) skill's `data-fields-and-protobuf.md` §"Payload wire shape" for the exact identifiers). Tesla's emission model (value-change + interval) typically batches `{latitude, longitude, heading}` and `{chargeLevel, estimatedRange}` together in the same `Payload`, which satisfies NFR-3.1 for those groups without an extra server-side debounce. Gear updates are typically single-field (`gearPosition`) with `status` derived at broadcast time -- see §4.1.5.

#### 3.2.1 Debounce window (NFR-3.2)

The canonical v1 debounce window for atomic-group accumulation on the server is **500 ms** (`defaultGroupFlushInterval` in [`internal/ws/group_accumulator.go`](../../internal/ws/group_accumulator.go)).

> **Scope note.** The 500 ms debounce applies ONLY to the **navigation** atomic group. GPS position (`latitude`, `longitude`, `heading`) is ungrouped at the server and arrives on Tesla's per-field emission cadence (see §4.1.3 and §4.1.7). `speed` is likewise ungrouped (§4.1.7, DV-10). A consumer rendering a live map therefore sees position updates at Tesla's native cadence (typically ~2 Hz driven by the 10-meter GPS delta filter, independent of the nav group), while nav-group fields (ETA, destination, polyline, trip distance) refresh at most twice per second. Two-hertz nav refresh is perceptually smooth for route-line rendering because the underlying polyline rarely changes shape at that rate; it is the destination/ETA text readout that benefits most from the debounce by avoiding half-updated reads.

**This is NOT a server-side design choice -- it is a Tesla-side floor.** The Tesla fleet telemetry emission model batches field changes in **500 ms buckets on the vehicle side**: multiple field changes that occur within the same 500 ms window are already coalesced into a single upstream `Payload` message before the server sees them. A shorter server-side accumulator window (e.g., the 200 ms literal in the current NFR-3.2 text) would fire before straggler fields from the SAME logical update have arrived, causing exactly the half-updated UI race that the accumulator exists to prevent. See the [`tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme`](../../.claude/skills/tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme/) skill's `architecture-and-setup.md` §"Emission model" for the authoritative reference on the 500 ms bucket behavior.

> **Note on `interval_seconds` minimums.** The MyRoboTaxi server configures its nav-field requests at `interval_seconds: 1` in [`internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go`](../../internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go) lines 112-118. Whether Tesla itself imposes a hard **1-second minimum** on the `interval_seconds` parameter is currently undocumented in the Tesla sources the `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill has verified -- the 1-second value is our highest-cadence request, not a published Tesla floor. The 500 ms vehicle-side batch behavior above is the authoritative argument for the 500 ms accumulator window; the `interval_seconds` parameter sets the REQUESTED cadence, while the 500 ms bucket sets the DELIVERED-as-one-message cadence. Do not conflate the two.

The NFR-3.2 literal of 200 ms was authored before this Tesla constraint was understood and is incorrect. Amending NFR-3.2 in `requirements.md` from 200 ms to 500 ms is a prerequisite follow-up tracked as **DV-01** in §10 (requirement-drift divergence, not implementation drift -- the server is correct and the requirement is wrong).

For the purpose of this wire contract: **SDKs MUST NOT assume any specific debounce timing**. Two updates to the same atomic group arriving within the debounce window MAY be coalesced into a single frame. The only guarantee is the atomic-group rule above.

### 3.3 Sequence and timestamp (NFR-3.11)

The Linear AC for MYR-11 calls for a "type discriminator, sequence, timestamp" envelope. Today only the `type` discriminator and per-payload `timestamp` field exist. The envelope-level `seq` and `ts` fields are **PLANNED** (DV-02). This doc and the AsyncAPI spec describe the **target shape** so SDK consumers can plan for it. Until the server begins emitting these fields, SDKs MUST tolerate their absence.

Rationale for not shipping `seq`/`ts` in v1.0:

1. The current server has no per-connection sequence counter — the [`client.go:Client`](../../internal/ws/client.go) struct does not carry a `nextSeq` field, and adding one would touch every broadcast hot-path.
2. Reconnect-resume is currently implemented entirely client-side via REST snapshot fetch (see [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §5), which establishes a consistent baseline without needing wire-level sequence numbers. The trade-off: clients cannot detect dropped frames within a single connection.
3. Adding `seq` is a coordinated server + SDK + fixture change. It is a v1.x extension, not a v1.0 ship blocker.

> **SDK MUST:** treat `seq` and `ts` as optional. When they appear, prefer envelope `ts` over payload `timestamp` for ordering.
>
> **SDK SHOULD:** maintain a per-connection "highest seq seen" counter as soon as the server begins emitting `seq`, and pass it as `subscribe.sinceSeq` (§5.2) on reconnect.

### 3.4 Frame size

The server enforces a 4 KiB read limit on inbound (client->server) frames via `Conn.SetReadLimit(readLimit)` ([`internal/ws/client.go`](../../internal/ws/client.go) line 19). The expected client traffic is exclusively `auth` plus the PLANNED control frames -- 4 KiB is generous.

Outbound (server->client) frames have no hard cap. Long `navRouteCoordinates` payloads from city-scale Tesla routes are the largest realistic frames (~5-15 KB serialized). SDKs MUST tolerate server->client frames up to 1 MB without truncation; beyond that is a server-side bug.

---

## 4. Server -> client message catalog

> **Anchored:** FR-1.1, FR-1.2, FR-1.3, FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, FR-3.1, FR-7.1, FR-8.1, FR-8.2, NFR-3.1, NFR-3.2.

This section is the wire-level catalog. Field-level types, units, nullability, and per-field data classification live in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) and the canonical JSON Schema ([`schemas/vehicle-state.schema.json`](schemas/vehicle-state.schema.json)) -- they are not duplicated here.

### Catalog summary

| `type` | Direction | Source (Go) | Atomic group | Triggers `dataState` transition | Fixture (planned) |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| `auth_ok` | server->client | [`handler.go:sendAuthOk`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) | n/a | `connecting -> connected` (C-3) | [`fixtures/websocket/auth_ok.json`](fixtures/README.md) |
| `vehicle_update` | server->client | [`nav_broadcast.go`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go) / [`route_broadcast.go`](../../internal/ws/route_broadcast.go) | one of `navigation`, `charge`, `gps`, `gear`, or none | per-group `ready/cleared/error -> ready` (D-3 / D-9 / D-12), or `ready -> cleared` on nav clear (D-5) | [`fixtures/websocket/vehicle_update.*.json`](fixtures/README.md) |
| `drive_started` | server->client | [`broadcaster.go:handleDriveStarted`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) | n/a | drive lifecycle `idle -> driving` (DR-1) / `ended -> driving` (DR-6) | [`fixtures/websocket/drive_started.json`](fixtures/README.md) |

All fixture files are authored in [`fixtures/`](fixtures/) -- see [`fixtures/README.md`](fixtures/README.md) for the complete index. DV-05 is **RESOLVED** by MYR-13.

> **Per-party delivery (ride-hailing frames).** The two `ride_*` frames are NOT vehicle-scoped like the telemetry/drive frames — they are **per-party unicast**: delivered only to the connections of the ride's two parties (the requesting **rider** and the vehicle **owner**), by user id, via [`Hub.SendToUsers`](../../internal/ws/hub.go). A vehicle-keyed `Hub.Broadcast` would leak the ride to every other shared viewer of that vehicle, so ride frames deliberately do not use the §4.5 ownership-filter path. Both frames are **summary-only** (same rationale as `drive_ended`/DV-11): they carry ids + status + enough to badge the right card; the pickup/dropoff places and booked-for passenger (P1) are NEVER on the broadcast — clients refetch `GET /api/ride-requests/{id}` for the full record.

### 4.1 `vehicle_update`

> **Anchored:** FR-1.1, FR-1.2, FR-1.3, FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, NFR-3.1, NFR-3.2, NFR-3.5, NFR-3.9.
>
> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/VehicleUpdatePayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)

The primary telemetry payload. One frame carries field updates for one vehicle, scoped to at most one atomic group per §3.2.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "vehicle_update",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "fields": {
      // members of AT MOST one atomic group + any number of ungrouped fields
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:22:01Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `payload.vehicleId` | `string` (cuid) | **P0** | Opaque DB ID, never VIN (FR-4.2, `data-classification.md` §1.3 `Vehicle.id`). |
| `payload.fields` | `object` | mixed per-field | See [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §1.1. Atomic-group membership enforced per §3.2. |
| `payload.timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | Server's `time.Now().UTC()` at broadcast (for nav flushes) or telemetry event `CreatedAt` (for non-nav broadcasts). See [`nav_broadcast.go:handleTelemetry`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go) and [`flushGroup`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go). |

#### 4.1.1 Wire field names vs. internal names

The wire field names in `payload.fields` are the **frontend / SDK** names, not the Tesla protobuf names. The server translates internal telemetry names to client names in [`internal/ws/field_mapping.go:internalToClientField`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go):

| Tesla / internal name | Wire field name |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `soc` | `chargeLevel` |
| `gear` | `gearPosition` |
| `odometer` | `odometerMiles` |
| `insideTemp` | `interiorTemp` |
| `outsideTemp` | `exteriorTemp` |
| `minutesToArrival` | `etaMinutes` |
| `milesToArrival` | `tripDistanceRemaining` |
| `fsdMilesSinceReset` | `fsdMilesSinceReset` |
| `location` (compound) | split into `latitude` + `longitude` |
| `destinationLocation` | split into `destinationLatitude` + `destinationLongitude` |
| `originLocation` | split into `originLatitude` + `originLongitude` |
| `routeLine` (Tesla encoded polyline) | `navRouteCoordinates` (decoded `[lng, lat]` array) |

Integer rounding is applied server-side to the fields listed in `integerFields` (`speed`, `heading`, `chargeLevel`, `estimatedRange`, `etaMinutes`, `interiorTemp`, `exteriorTemp`, `odometerMiles`, `fanSpeed`, `driverTempSetting`, `passengerTempSetting`, `seatHeaterLeft`/`Right`, `seatHeaterRearLeft`/`Center`/`Right`, `seatCoolerLeft`/`Right`). `mediaVolume` (MYR-252) is intentionally NOT rounded — it is a fractional level. See [`field_mapping.go:roundIfInteger`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go).

SDKs MUST accept the integer-rounded values as-is and MUST NOT round-trip through floats.

#### 4.1.2 Navigation group

> **Anchored:** FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, NFR-3.1, NFR-3.2, NFR-3.9.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.navigation` (per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §2)
> **Fixtures:** `vehicle_update.nav_active.json`, `vehicle_update.nav_clear.json` (planned, [`fixtures/README.md`](fixtures/README.md))

Members (per [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §2.1): `destinationName`, `destinationAddress`, `destinationLatitude`, `destinationLongitude`, `originLatitude`, `originLongitude`, `etaMinutes`, `tripDistanceRemaining`, `navRouteCoordinates`.

| Field | Classification | Encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) |
|-------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `destinationName` | **P1** | No (disk encryption only) |
| `destinationAddress` | **P1** | No |
| `destinationLatitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `destinationLongitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `originLatitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `originLongitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `etaMinutes` | **P0** | No |
| `tripDistanceRemaining` | **P0** | No |
| `navRouteCoordinates` | **P1** | Yes |

Encryption flags are from [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §3.1.

**Server flow:** All nav-related Tesla fields (`destinationName`, `destinationLocation`, `originLocation`, `routeLine`, `minutesToArrival`, `milesToArrival`) are routed through [`groupAccumulator.Add(groupNavigation, …)`](../../internal/ws/group_accumulator.go) via [`handleTelemetry`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go). The accumulator starts a timer on the first nav field for a VIN and merges subsequent nav fields within the flush window. On timer expiry the batch is delivered via [`flushGroup`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go), which resolves VIN -> vehicleId, maps fields, appends a `lastUpdated`, and broadcasts a single `vehicle_update`. The accumulator is also drained synchronously on `drive_ended` and on `connectivity.online=false` ([`broadcaster.go`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go)), so pending nav fields never outlive their relevance.

**Nav clear (FR-2.3):** When Tesla marks a nav field as `Invalid`, the server translates each invalid field to a JSON `null` in `payload.fields`. The mapping is defined by [`navClearFields`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go) line 78:

| Internal field invalidated | Client fields set to `null` |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `destinationName` | `destinationName` |
| `milesToArrival` | `tripDistanceRemaining` |
| `minutesToArrival` | `etaMinutes` |
| `routeLine` | `navRouteCoordinates` |
| `originLocation` | `originLatitude`, `originLongitude` |
| `destinationLocation` | `destinationLatitude`, `destinationLongitude` |

**SDK amplification rule (NFR-3.9 + Rule CG-SM-3):** When ANY nav group field arrives as `null`, the SDK MUST null ALL navigation group fields atomically in its in-memory state, regardless of whether the server explicitly sent every member. The server is permitted (and does today) to send a partial clear -- the SDK is responsible for amplifying it to the full group. This is non-negotiable: it's the only way to satisfy the "no half-cleared nav" invariant (NFR-3.4).

#### 4.1.3 GPS group

> **Anchored:** FR-1.1, NFR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.gps`
> **Fixture:** `vehicle_update.gps.json` (planned)

Members: `latitude`, `longitude`, `heading`.

| Field | Classification | Encrypted at rest |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| `latitude` | **P1** | Yes (AES-256-GCM) |
| `longitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `heading` | **P0** | No |

**Server flow:** When Tesla emits a `Location` compound value, the server splits it into separate `latitude` and `longitude` keys via [`splitLocationField`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go). `heading` is delivered alongside whenever Tesla emits `GpsHeading`. There is no dedicated server-side accumulator for GPS -- `handleTelemetry` broadcasts non-nav fields immediately. Tesla's upstream emission typically batches `location` + `heading` together, which delivers them in the same outbound `vehicle_update` in practice.

**0,0 sentinel:** Per [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §2.3, the DB default for unset coordinates is `(0, 0)`. SDKs MUST treat `latitude == 0 && longitude == 0` as "no fix" rather than a valid point in the Gulf of Guinea.

#### 4.1.4 Charge group

> **Anchored:** FR-1.2, NFR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.charge`
> **Fixture:** `vehicle_update.charge.json` (planned)

Members (v1): `chargeLevel`, `chargeState`, `estimatedRange`, `timeToFull`. All **P0** (log-safe, no encryption at rest).

| Field | Type | Unit | Tesla source | Notes |
|-------|------|------|--------------|-------|
| `chargeLevel` | `integer` (0-100) | percent | proto field `Soc` / `BatteryLevel` | Integer-rounded server-side. |
| `chargeState` | `string` (enum) | -- | proto field **179** (`DetailedChargeState`) | Enum values: `Unknown`, `Disconnected`, `NoPower`, `Starting`, `Charging`, `Complete`, `Stopped`. **Re-sourced from proto 2 to proto 179 by MYR-42 on 2026-04-23** — empirical capture showed Tesla firmware ≥ 2024.44.25 accepts proto 2 in `fleet_telemetry_config` but never emits it. Proto 179 fires on the same transitions with identical enum string values via the `Value_DetailedChargeStateValue` oneof variant (primary) or `Value_ChargingValue` (pre-2024.44.25 fallback). See §10 DV-19 for the full capture + analysis. |
| `estimatedRange` | `integer` | miles | proto `EstBatteryRange` | Integer-rounded server-side. |
| `timeToFull` | `number` | **hours** (decimal) | proto field **43** (`TimeToFullCharge`, `double`) | **Hours** (decimal, fractional values supported -- e.g. `1.5` for 90 minutes) to full charge at the current rate. `0` (or `null` when disconnected) means no active charging session. Unit is sourced from the `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill's `data-fields-and-protobuf.md` §"TimeToFullCharge" ("Estimated hours to reach charge limit") and the legacy Tesla REST API `time_to_full_charge` field, both of which consistently use hours. Tesla proto type is `double`, so the wire value is a JSON number (NOT rounded to integer). **Empirical verification of the unit against a charging vehicle is tracked as DV-17** -- if the observed value disagrees with the skill reference, this row MUST be corrected before any SDK build that generates types against it ships. |

**Server flow:** Mapped from Tesla's native fields above. All four fields are in `DefaultFieldConfig` at the 30-second cadence (MYR-40 landed `FleetFieldChargeState` and `FleetFieldTimeToFullCharge`; `FleetFieldSOC` / `FleetFieldBatteryLevel` / `FleetFieldEstBatteryRange` were already there). When any field changes in the same Tesla 500 ms vehicle-side bucket, they arrive in a single upstream `Payload` protobuf message and the broadcaster emits a four-field batch in one `vehicle_update`. If only a subset changes within a bucket, Tesla emits just that subset — the atomic-group promise is "siblings are included when change happens together," not "every frame carries all four."

**Implementation status:** wire delivery is live as of MYR-40; REST `/snapshot` persistence (DB columns for `chargeState` + `timeToFull` on the Prisma-owned `Vehicle` table) landed in MYR-41 (cross-repo Prisma migration in `../react-frontend` + Go `internal/store` SELECT/UPDATE wiring). Both fields are now persisted on every telemetry event via the writer pipeline; the cold-start snapshot reads them back from the DB.

> **SDK MUST** continue to tolerate `null` for `chargeState` and `timeToFull` on REST `/snapshot` responses. The DB columns are nullable — a vehicle that has never charged (or whose first charge frame has not arrived yet after the MYR-41 deploy) will surface `null` until Tesla emits a value. Steady-state non-null is expected once the vehicle has charged at least once post-deploy.

> **Generated SDK types.** `chargeState` and `timeToFull` remain nullable in generated SDK types (`string | null` in TypeScript, `String?` / `Optional<String>` in Swift, `Double?` for `timeToFull` in Swift) — the DB columns are `String?` / `Float?` and may be null for vehicles that have never charged.
>
> **Consumer UI.** SDK consumers rendering charge state SHOULD surface `null` as a neutral placeholder (`--`, `—`, or hide the field entirely), NOT as a loading spinner. With `dataState.charge = ready` and `chargeState: null`, the steady-state meaning is "no data yet from Tesla for this field," NOT "loading in progress." A spinner implies work is in flight, which is misleading. A time-to-full display might read `— minutes remaining` while the vehicle is disconnected; a charge-state badge might hide until `chargeState` becomes non-null.

#### 4.1.5 Gear group

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.gear`
> **Fixture:** `vehicle_update.gear.json` (planned)

Members: `gearPosition`, `status`. Both **P0**.

`status` is **derived server-side** at broadcast time by [`deriveVehicleStatus`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go) from `gearPosition` (and `speed` as a fallback when gear is missing). The broadcaster injects `status` into the `vehicle_update` iff `gearPosition` is present in the same frame:

```go
// internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go:60-62
if _, hasGear := fields["gearPosition"]; hasGear {
    fields["status"] = deriveVehicleStatus(fields)
}
```

Per [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §3.4 predicate 1, the SDK MUST validate the gear-to-status derivation on receipt: `D` or `R` => `driving`, `P` or `N` => `parked` (unless overridden by `charging`, `offline`, or `in_service` from server-side logic). A mismatch is logged as a consistency error but the frame is still applied.

#### 4.1.6 Drive route updates (`drive_updated` is virtual)

> **Anchored:** FR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.gps`
> **Drive lifecycle target:** `driving -> driving` (DR-2)
> **Fixture:** [`vehicle_update.route.json`](fixtures/websocket/vehicle_update.route.json)

**`driveTrailCoordinates` vs `navRouteCoordinates` -- two different polylines.** The wire carries two distinct route polylines and they MUST NOT be conflated:

| Wire field | Source | Semantics | Atomic group? | Section |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `driveTrailCoordinates` | [`routeAccumulator`](../../internal/ws/route_accumulator.go) (server-side, fed by `drive_updated` events) | **Where the car has been** -- the accumulated GPS trail of the active drive | No -- drive-only ungrouped field, routed to `dataState.gps` | This section (§4.1.6) |
| `navRouteCoordinates` | Tesla `routeLine` protobuf decode ([`internal/ws/field_mapping.go`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go)) | **Where the car is going** -- Tesla's planned route polyline to the active destination | Yes -- member of the `navigation` atomic group | §4.1.2 |

Renaming, atomic-group reassignment, or merging of these two fields is a contract change; both names are owned by [`docs/contracts/schemas/ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json) and the v1 mask matrix in [`internal/mask/tables.go`](../../internal/mask/tables.go).

**Wire shape.** Per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.1, `drive_updated` is **NOT a distinct wire message type**. During an active drive, the broadcaster's [`handleDriveUpdated`](../../internal/ws/route_broadcast.go) appends each GPS point to a per-VIN [`routeAccumulator`](../../internal/ws/route_accumulator.go). When the accumulator hits its batch threshold (`defaultRouteBatchSize = 5`) or its flush interval (`defaultRouteFlushInterval = 3*time.Second`), the broadcaster sends a `vehicle_update` whose `payload.fields` contains a **single key** `driveTrailCoordinates`:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "vehicle_update",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "fields": {
      "driveTrailCoordinates": [[-122.4194, 37.7749], [-122.4193, 37.7750], ...]
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:23:05Z"
  }
}
```

Coordinates are `[lng, lat]` order (GeoJSON / Mapbox). Each element is a per-point pair derived from [`routeCoordinate`](../../internal/ws/route_accumulator.go). The accumulator's buffer is **not cleared on flush** -- each batch contains the **complete driven path** so the SDK can render the full polyline by replacing rather than appending. The buffer is cleared only on `drive_ended` ([`broadcaster.go:handleDriveEnded`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 162).

| Sub-field | Classification | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| `driveTrailCoordinates[i][0]` (lng) | **P1** | Same tier as `Vehicle.longitude` |
| `driveTrailCoordinates[i][1]` (lat) | **P1** | Same tier as `Vehicle.latitude` |

**SDK requirement:** On receipt of a `vehicle_update` containing `driveTrailCoordinates` during an active drive, the SDK MUST emit `drive_updated` as a logical event to consumers AND merge the array into its in-memory drive state. Per Rule CG-SM-6 in [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §7, the SDK MUST NOT synthesize `drive_updated` from any other source (no gear-change heuristics, no speed thresholds). Drive detection is server-only.

#### 4.1.7 Ungrouped fields

`speed` is delivered ungrouped even though `requirements.md` NFR-3.1 text puts it in the GPS group. This is a resolved decision in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §7.1: speed updates at 2 s cadence while GPS uses a 10 m delta filter, so coupling them would either delay speed updates or flood GPS updates. DV-10 records this as an accepted divergence from the NFR literal.

Other ungrouped fields: `odometerMiles`, `interiorTemp`, `exteriorTemp`, `fsdMilesSinceReset`, `locationName`, `locationAddress`, `lastUpdated`. None of these transition a `dataState` group on receipt (per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.3 footnote). Their freshness is implied by `connectionState`.

The MYR-252 cabin-control read-back fields are also ungrouped (individually delivered): `locked`, `hvacPower`, `isClimateOn`, `fanSpeed`, `driverTempSetting`, `passengerTempSetting`, `hvacAutoMode`, `hvacAcEnabled`, `seatHeaterLeft`/`Right`, `seatHeaterRearLeft`/`Center`/`Right`, `seatCoolerLeft`/`Right`, `seatVentEnabled`, `chargePortDoorOpen`, `frunkOpen`, `trunkOpen`, `mediaPlaybackStatus`, `mediaVolume`. Per-field types/units/classification (all P0) live in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §1.1; `frunkOpen`/`trunkOpen` are bit-decoded from Tesla `DoorState` (proto 58) per §6.3. These stream on the live `vehicle_update` wire but are NOT persisted, so they do not appear on the DB-backed REST `/snapshot` or the WS snapshot-on-connect frame until [MYR-253](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-253) adds the columns.

`lastUpdated` is set by the server on every outbound `vehicle_update` (in `nav_broadcast.go`'s `handleTelemetry` and `flushGroup`) to the event's `CreatedAt` for non-nav broadcasts or `time.Now().UTC()` for nav flushes. SDKs SHOULD surface this to consumers as the "most recent telemetry timestamp" for the vehicle.

### 4.2 `drive_started`

> **Anchored:** FR-3.1, NFR-3.1 (carries the `drive` atomic group's `startedAt` field per DV-13).
> **Drive lifecycle target:** `idle -> driving` (DR-1) or `ended -> driving` (DR-6)
> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/DriveStartedPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixture:** `drive_started.json` (planned)

```jsonc
{
  "type": "drive_started",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "driveId": "clmno9876543210zyxw",
    "startLocation": {
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194
    },
    "startedAt": "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `vehicleId` | `string` (cuid) | **P0** | |
| `driveId` | `string` (cuid) | **P0** | Matches the eventual persisted `Drive.id` at drive completion. |
| `startLocation.latitude` | `number` | **P1** | Encrypted at rest inside `Drive.routePoints` ([`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §1.5); plaintext on the wire under WSS (NFR-3.22). |
| `startLocation.longitude` | `number` | **P1** | Same as above. |
| `startedAt` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | **This is the v1 home of `tripStartTime`** per DV-13. Value is `StartedAt` from the drive detector's `DriveStartedEvent`. It is repeated alongside `timestamp` (below) rather than replacing it to make the SDK binding obvious: `DriveStarted.startedAt` is the semantic drive-lifecycle timestamp; `timestamp` is the envelope-equivalent event time. SDKs MUST treat `startedAt` as the authoritative `tripStartTime` for consumers. |
| `timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | Envelope-level event time. For `drive_started`, this is always equal to `startedAt`; the two are separate fields purely to keep every `server->client` message shape uniform on `timestamp`. |

**Note on DV-13 (`tripStartTime`).** NFR-3.1 originally listed `tripStartTime` as a member of the *navigation* atomic group. There is no Tesla field for `tripStartTime` -- it is derived from the drive detector's `started_at` timestamp in [`internal/drives/`](../../internal/drives/). Semantically it belongs with the drive, not with nav: forcing it into the nav group would require a cross-subsystem join that Tesla's 500 ms bucket floor (§3.2.1) cannot deliver atomically, and a vehicle can have no nav but still have an active drive. v1 therefore relocates `tripStartTime` from the `navigation` group to the `drive` group, where it is carried as `drive_started.payload.startedAt` on the wire. Amending the NFR-3.1 literal in `requirements.md` is a follow-up tracked as **DV-13** in §10.

Source: [`internal/drives/transitions.go`](../../internal/drives/transitions.go) publishes `events.DriveStartedEvent`; [`internal/ws/broadcaster.go:handleDriveStarted`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 99 resolves the VIN to a vehicleId and marshals the frame.

### 4.3 `drive_ended`

> **Anchored:** FR-3.1, FR-3.4 (with explicit scope note).
> **Drive lifecycle target:** `driving -> ended` (DR-3)
> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/DriveEndedPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixture:** `drive_ended.json` (planned)

**The `drive_ended` wire payload is a SUMMARY.** It carries only the handful of fields an SDK consumer needs to render an immediate "drive finished" toast / card / complication. The full FR-3.4 drive record is retrieved via REST `GET /drives/{id}`, which is the authoritative source for every field FR-3.4 lists. See the scope note below for the full contract.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "drive_ended",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "driveId": "clmno9876543210zyxw",
    "distance": 12.4,
    "durationSeconds": 1458,
    "avgSpeed": 30.5,
    "maxSpeed": 65.2,
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:46:18Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `vehicleId` | `string` | **P0** | |
| `driveId` | `string` | **P0** | Opaque drive cuid -- the input to `fetchDrive(driveId)` (see "SDK consumption" below). |
| `distance` | `number` (miles) | **P0** | Haversine sum from `DriveStats.Distance`. |
| `durationSeconds` | `number` (seconds) | **P0** | Drive duration in seconds, as a JSON number (`double`). Server-side value is `DriveStats.Duration.Seconds()`. **The earlier Go `time.Duration.String()` format (e.g. `"24m18s"`) is not part of the v1 wire contract** -- it was dropped before v1 ship because there are no pre-v1 consumers and the Go-native string would force every SDK to write a parser for a format it otherwise never sees. See DV-12 (RESOLVED). TypeScript consumers construct a `Date` delta or `Temporal.Duration` from this field; Swift consumers map directly to `Duration(secondsComponent:attosecondsComponent:)` or `TimeInterval`. |
| `avgSpeed` | `number` (mph) | **P0** | `DriveStats.AvgSpeed` |
| `maxSpeed` | `number` (mph) | **P0** | `DriveStats.MaxSpeed` |
| `timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | `EndedAt` from the drive detector. |

Source: [`internal/ws/broadcaster.go:handleDriveEnded`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 140. Server emits `DriveStats.Duration.Seconds()` as `durationSeconds` (DV-12 RESOLVED by MYR-32).

**SDK consumption.** The v1 SDK surface is:

- **TypeScript**: `client.onDriveEnded(cb)` for the live summary, `await client.fetchDrive(id)` for the full FR-3.4 record, plus a `useDrive(id)` React hook that wraps the fetch + local cache.
- **Swift**: `client.onDriveEnded { summary in ... }` for the live summary, `try await client.fetchDrive(summary.driveId)` for the full FR-3.4 record.

Neither SDK auto-fetches the full record on `drive_ended`: doing so would burn cellular bandwidth on every idle consumer (especially bad for watchOS, per NFR-3.36). Consumers that need the full record call `fetchDrive` explicitly when the UI renders a detail view.

> **Scope note (FR-3.4 vs wire payload).** `requirements.md` FR-3.4 lists the full drive record as `{distance, duration, avgSpeed, maxSpeed, energyUsed, fsdMiles, interventions, startChargeLevel, endChargeLevel, startLocation+address, endLocation+address}`. The **wire** `drive_ended` payload contains only the summary fields above. The remaining FR-3.4 fields are available via REST `GET /drives/{id}` (see [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md)) and are persisted in the `Drive` table ([`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §1.4). The canonical references for this split are [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §3.3 (drive lifecycle -> `ended`) and [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.1 (`drive_ended` event), plus [`data-lifecycle.md`](data-lifecycle.md) for the persistence side. This is not a divergence -- the split between "real-time fast summary" and "post-hoc full record" is intentional for NFR-3.1 latency reasons and was confirmed by both SDK agents (Option A: summary on wire + explicit `fetchDrive(driveId)` helper). Tracked as **DV-11** (RESOLVED) in §10 for audit-trail continuity.

> **Micro-drive filter:** Drives that fail the micro-drive filter (default 2 minutes / 0.1 miles, [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §3.5) NEVER produce a `drive_ended` frame. The SDK relies on `WS_DISCONNECTED` (DR-4) or an extended absence of route updates as the only signal that an in-progress drive was suppressed. This is documented behavior, not a divergence.

### 4.4 `connectivity`

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/ConnectivityPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixtures:** `connectivity.online.json`, `connectivity.offline.json` (planned)

```jsonc
{
  "type": "connectivity",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "online": true,
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `vehicleId` | `string` | **P0** |
| `online` | `boolean` | **P0** |
| `timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** |

**Important distinction:** `connectivity.online` reports the **vehicle<->server** (Tesla mTLS) connection status, NOT the **SDK client<->server** (WebSocket) status. The latter is implicit in the WebSocket connection itself -- an absent connection IS the disconnected state.

Per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.2, `connectivity` does NOT directly transition `connectionState` -- the SDK already knows its WebSocket is open, since it just received a frame on it. The signal is informational: the UI may show "Vehicle offline" while continuing to display cached data. When the server emits `connectivity.online: false`, the broadcaster also clears any pending nav accumulator state for that VIN to prevent stale nav data on reconnect ([`broadcaster.go:handleConnectivity`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 227).

### 4.5 Per-vehicle ownership filtering

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.21.

`Hub.Broadcast(vehicleID, msg)` ([`internal/ws/hub.go`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 70) iterates every connected client and calls `client.hasVehicle(vehicleID)`. Only clients whose `vehicleIDs` slice (populated at handshake time from `Authenticator.GetUserVehicles`) contains the target vehicle ID receive the frame. The dev-mode `NoopAuthenticator` returns the `WildcardVehicleID` sentinel ([`auth.go`](../../internal/ws/auth.go)) from `GetUserVehicles`; the handshake translates that into `Client.allVehicles = true` and `hasVehicle` short-circuits to `true` for those clients. Production `Authenticator` implementations MUST NOT emit the sentinel, so `allVehicles` is always `false` on production: an empty `vehicleIDs` slice means deny-all per NFR-3.21.

The SDK can rely on the following contract: **an authenticated production client will NEVER receive a `vehicle_update`, `drive_started`, `drive_ended`, or `connectivity` frame for a vehicle it does not own at handshake time.**

> **Divergence (DV-09 — RESOLVED for access loss):** Both ways a client can LOSE access are now propagated mid-connection, and neither waits for a reconnect.
>
> - **Vehicle deletion** (MYR-73, 2026-05-09): a Postgres `vehicle_deleted` LISTEN/NOTIFY trigger drives a hub-side `RemoveVehicle` call that closes affected clients with code 4002 within seconds of the Next.js commit.
> - **Share revoke and suspend** (MYR-373, 2026-08-02): `DELETE /api/invites/{inviteId}` and a suspending `PATCH /api/invites/{inviteId}` publish `share.access_revoked` on the in-process bus, and a hub dispatcher closes **that grantee's** sessions for **that vehicle** with the same 4002 frame. Scoped to the grantee — the owner's own session and every other viewer's keep streaming, because the car has not gone anywhere. A periodic revalidation sweep backstops the nudge. See §4.5.1.
>
> **The GAIN direction is now propagated too (MYR-609, MYR-601).** A client that becomes entitled to MORE than its handshake snapshot says used to see the wider set only after reconnecting on its own. That direction fails safe — the client is shown less than it could be, never more — and had no live producer, so it was catalogued rather than fixed. §7.5.8 share extend was the first producer (§4.5.2); MYR-601 then found that it was never the only one, and wired the remaining four — owner provisioning, the owner-wins transfer, §7.5.5 redeem and §7.24 ride join — to the same signal (§4.5.3). Every event that adds a vehicle to somebody's access set now announces it, **and the 60s revalidation sweep backstops the gain direction too since MYR-601** — which matters because one widening writer is outside this process entirely (the Next.js app's direct `"Vehicle"` insert) and can publish nothing. See §10 DV-09.

`heartbeat` frames are broadcast to ALL clients regardless of vehicle ownership via [`Hub.BroadcastAll`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 90 -- they carry no vehicle-scoped data.

#### 4.5.1 Mid-connection revocation of a share grant (MYR-373)

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.21. Closes the share half of §10 DV-09. **No wire change** — every mechanism below is server behavior plus the close code §6.2 already defines.

An owner who suspends or revokes a viewer expects the live map to stop, not to stop eventually. Before MYR-373 it stopped at the next reconnect, because `Client.vehicleIDs` is frozen at handshake (§2.2) and nothing re-read it. Two mechanisms now close that gap.

**1. The nudge (primary).** On a successful `DELETE /api/invites/{inviteId}` or a `PATCH` that leaves the grant `suspended`, the REST handler — **after** committing the mutation and **after** busting the grantee's cached access set — publishes `share.access_revoked` (`events.ShareAccessRevokedEvent{GranteeUserID, VehicleID, Reason}`) on the in-process bus. A hub-side dispatcher calls `Hub.RevokeUserAccess(userID, vehicleID, reason)`, which:

- marks the matching sessions cut off **synchronously**, so no further frame is enqueued for them from that instant. The flag is enforced in **`Client.enqueue`, the only writer to a client's send channel**, so it covers every producer at once: the broadcast paths (`Broadcast`, `BroadcastMasked`) *and* **`Hub.sendSnapshot`**, which unicasts persisted vehicle state on `subscribe` and reaches the client without consulting the broadcast-side ownership check at all. `sendSnapshot` and `handleSubscribeFrame` check the flag as well, so a revoked session's `subscribe` is refused before the database is read rather than after. All three matter: a revoked session can still send frames during the close handshake, and `subscribe` is gated on the handshake-frozen ownership set, which still names the vehicle the owner just took away; then
- closes each connection with **`4002` / `vehicle access revoked`** — byte-identical to the vehicle-deletion close, so no client needs new handling — with the close handshake performed off the caller's goroutine, because a graceful WebSocket close waits up to five seconds for the peer to echo and one unresponsive viewer must not stall the next revocation; and
- **signals the session's write pump to exit**, so the session is fully torn down and unregisters rather than merely going silent. This is not bookkeeping: once the cut-off refuses every frame, the write pump can never again be woken by a message, and it gates the teardown that removes the session from the hub. A revoked session therefore leaves the connected-clients set on its own, bounded by the close-handshake timeout **even if the peer never acknowledges the close**.

Measured end to end over a real socket, the client observes the close **within a millisecond** of the handler's notification (`cmd/telemetry-server/share_access_dispatcher_test.go`).

**Scoping is the whole point.** `RevokeUserAccess` is keyed on the **grantee**, unlike `RemoveVehicle` which is keyed on the vehicle. The owner's own session and every other viewer's session keep streaming: one grant moved, the car did not go away. An empty grantee id closes **nothing** — it is never read as a wildcard.

**Ordering is load-bearing.** The cache bust must precede the notification. The close provokes the SDK's reconnect, the reconnect re-runs the handshake, and a handshake served from a stale cache would hand the access straight back.

**2. The revalidation sweep (backstop).** Every `ws.DefaultRevalidateInterval` (60s) the server re-derives each connected user's access set and closes any session still holding a vehicle that set no longer contains. It exists because the nudge is not a delivery guarantee — the bus drops the oldest event under backpressure, a mutation served by a different machine reaches this hub through nothing at all, and a future write path could forget to publish. It **fails open** on a resolver error: a database blip must not disconnect the fleet. **Since MYR-601 the same pass also closes a session that is MISSING a vehicle the user can now see** (§4.5.3), so the one sweep backstops both directions; the two outcomes are counted separately (`sessions_closed` / `sessions_widened`) for the same reason the two bus topics are separate.

**Bounds a consumer can rely on:**

| Case | Bound |
|---|---|
| Mutation served by the same instance (the deployment today: one Fly machine) | **sub-millisecond**, via the nudge; 60s if the event is ever dropped |
| Mutation served by another instance, multi-machine deployment | **≤ ~6 min** — the other instance's access-set cache lapses on its own 5-minute TTL, then the next 60s sweep closes the socket. This is the same per-process-cache caveat `rest-api.md` §7.5.3(a) already records for revoke. |

**A revoked session cannot talk its way back in.** The close is graceful, so the peer's frames are still serviced while it completes — and `subscribe` is gated on the **handshake-frozen** ownership set, which still names the vehicle the owner just took away. Left alone, a revoked viewer could re-`subscribe` and be unicast the vehicle's persisted snapshot (GPS included) on the way out. Three checks close that: `Client.enqueue` (the choke point), `Hub.sendSnapshot` (before the database read), and `handleSubscribeFrame` (at the entry, before the ownership test that would wrongly say yes).

**The refusal must not become a reconnect loop.** A viewer who loses a grant reconnects and re-sends the `subscribe` its stale local state still lists. On that new connection the reduced set is correct and the vehicle is genuinely not theirs, so the server answers `vehicle_not_owned` **and leaves the connection open** (§6.1.1). Closing there — which is what this server did before MYR-373 — would send the client straight back round: reconnect, subscribe, closed, reconnect. The server must never be the thing driving that loop; dropping the stale vehicle from the client's own subscription list is the client's half ([MYR-432](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-432)).

**What is NOT covered here.** A grant being *widened* (a capability gained) is handled by §4.5.2 since MYR-609, not by this section — the two are separate events and separate topics on purpose. `allowRides` has no WebSocket effect at all and deliberately does not close anything in either direction: it governs the §7.8 ride surface, so tearing down a live map over it would be a disconnection for a change that does not touch the live map.


#### 4.5.2 Mid-connection WIDENING of a share grant (MYR-609)

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.21. Closes the GAIN half of §10 DV-09. **No wire change** — the mechanism is server behavior plus the close code §6.2 already defines, and the frame is byte-identical to §4.5.1's.

§4.5.1 fixed the dangerous direction of a stale handshake snapshot. The snapshot is stale in **both** directions, and the harmless one stopped being invisible when `POST /api/vehicles/{vehicleId}/share/extend` (`rest-api.md` §7.5.8) shipped: an owner adds a car to somebody who is **connected**, the owner is told the share worked, the grantee's REST surface lists the car, and their live map does not have it until they happen to reconnect — possibly for the rest of the session. Nobody involved can see why.

**The mechanism is the narrowing one, mirrored.** After committing the grant and **after** busting the grantee's cached access set, the handler publishes the internal-only `share.access_widened` (`events.ShareAccessWidenedEvent{GranteeUserID, VehicleID, Reason}`); a hub dispatcher calls `Hub.WidenUserAccess(userID, vehicleID, reason)`, which closes the grantee's sessions so the reconnect re-derives everything. **Ordering is load-bearing for the mirror-image reason:** the close provokes the reconnect, and a handshake served from the pre-mutation cache would come back **without** the car — a no-op that looks like a fix.

**Two things differ from §4.5.1, and both fall out of the direction.**

1. **Every session is closed, not the ones holding the vehicle.** `RevokeUserAccess` narrows to the sessions authorized for the affected car. A grantee who just GAINED a car is by definition not yet authorized for it, so the same filter would match nothing and the widening would silently do nothing.
2. **The frame is the same `4002`, deliberately.** §6.2 defines 4002's client contract as *"reconnect, then render whatever the new handshake returns"*, with an explicit instruction not to auto-retry a `subscribe` for the vehicle that was open — which is exactly correct here, and is behaviour every deployed SDK already has. The reason string is byte-identical too, so **a widening and a narrowing are indistinguishable on the wire**. That is a feature: the correct client behaviour is the same for both, and the client learns what actually changed by reconnecting, which is the only honest way to learn either. A new 4xxx code would be a wire change that bought nothing and would be worse for any client that did not recognise it.

**A separate event and topic from `share.access_revoked`, not a `reason` on it.** The hub call underneath is nearly the same; the two are opposite in the property that matters everywhere else. A revocation is a **security** action whose latency is a live GPS leak and which must fail closed; a widening is a convenience whose worst outcome is a car appearing one reconnect later. Anything that watches, counts, alerts on or rate-limits revocations must not have widenings folded into its numbers.

**Best-effort, and its failure mode is a delay.** A dropped publish, a nil widener (dev mode, or a deployment without a bus) or a grantee who is simply offline all cost the same thing: the car appears at the next reconnect or at the 60-second revalidation sweep. None of them can produce a wrong answer, and the owner's `201` never depends on anybody being online to hear about it.

> **Correction (MYR-601): when this paragraph was written, the sweep it names could not do what it says.** The `ws.AccessRevalidator` of the day only ever NARROWED — it closed a session holding a vehicle the user could no longer see, and re-masked the tiers of the ones it kept. A dropped widening therefore had no backstop at all and cost the car for the whole life of that session, not one interval. MYR-601 gave the sweep a WIDEN arm (§4.5.3), which is what makes this paragraph's ≤60s bound true.

**[MYR-601](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-601) turned out to be the same class and four producers wide** — see §4.5.3, which reuses this pipeline exactly as this paragraph asked the next producer to.


#### 4.5.3 Every OTHER widening producer (MYR-601)

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.21. Completes the GAIN half of §10 DV-09 — **no wire change, no new mechanism, no new topic.** Everything here publishes `share.access_widened` and lands on §4.5.2's `Hub.WidenUserAccess`.

§4.5.2 fixed one producer and recorded that a second would come. It came as a field report rather than a design note. On 2026-09-06 an owner linked a second car; the row existed at 05:24:21Z and `GET /api/vehicles` rendered it at once, but for the next four minutes **every** handshake reported the pre-link vehicle count and every `subscribe` for the new car was refused `vehicle_not_owned`. At 05:28:42Z a handshake finally saw it. Nothing in the WS layer was wrong: the app was **connected**, so its access-set cache entry was warm and served the pre-link answer for the length of the 5-minute TTL, and its open session's `vehicleIDs` had been frozen before the car existed.

That is not a WebSocket bug and it is not a cache bug. It is a **missing producer** — and an audit of `queryUserVehicleIDs`, the one statement every access decision resolves through, found that share extend had been the only one of its five widening events that announced anything.

**The rule, stated once:** *every event that adds a vehicle to a user's access set busts that user's cached set and then publishes `share.access_widened`.* Bust first, always — a re-handshake served from the stale cache comes back without the car, which is a no-op that looks like a fix.

| Event | Where | `reason` | Announced when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Owner provisioning (in-app Tesla link, deliberate re-add) | `cmd/telemetry-server/owner_stream_hook.go` | `provisioned` | the upsert **created** the row (`xmax = 0`). A passive re-link that merely reconciles a car the user has had for months announces nothing — otherwise every Tesla re-consent would re-handshake every session that owner holds. |
| Owner-wins transfer (MYR-599) | same hook | `owner_transfer` (gain) + `superseded_by_owner` (loss, on `share.access_revoked`) | the car moved. **Two announcements**: the arriving owner gains it, and the former driver — whose shares the same transaction revoked — loses it. |
| Share redeem (§7.5.5) | `internal/telemetry/share_redeem_handler.go` | `redeemed` | the redemption granted anything. **One signal per redemption**, not per car: `WidenUserAccess` re-handshakes every session the user holds, so one publish already covers a multi-vehicle invite. |
| Un-suspending a grant (§7.5.4 `PATCH`) | `internal/telemetry/share_invite_patch_handler.go` | `unsuspended` | the request asked for `suspended: false`. Read off the **request**, not the resulting row — `suspended == false` is also true of an `allowRides`-only patch, and `allowRides` has no WebSocket effect in either direction (§4.5.1). |
| Group-ride join (§7.24) | `internal/telemetry/ride_request_join_handler.go` | `ride_joined` | the join **created** a membership row. An idempotent re-join announces nothing. |

**A driver-access car widens exactly like an owner's.** The MYR-599 consent gate holds the Tesla-side config **push**, not the row: an unacknowledged driver car is in its linker's access set from the instant it is provisioned, §7.0 lists it, and their app must be able to subscribe to it. The §7.29 acknowledgment that opens the gate therefore changes **no** access set and announces nothing — the widening already happened, at provisioning.

**Trip participant add (§7.30.4) announces nothing, and that is a finding rather than an omission.** A trip participant is structurally always an accepted, unsuspended share-holder on that same car (`queryAcceptedShareParticipants`), so the vehicle is already in their access set through leg 2 of `queryUserVehicleIDs`. What an add changes, inside an open window, is their **role tier** — `viewer` → `trip_participant` — which is the `ws.AccessRevalidator`'s in-place re-mask, the mechanism MYR-602 built for window edges. Its bound is one sweep interval (≤60s), not the millisecond a widen gives, and that is recorded as a known latency rather than fixed here: closing every session a person holds to elevate a role the re-mask can change in place would trade a correct mechanism for a faster one.

**The re-delivered state carries the right mask.** Because every widening is a re-handshake and never an in-place edit of `Client.vehicleIDs` / `vehicleRoles`, the reconnect re-derives the access set **and** `ResolveRole` per vehicle in the one place that does it correctly (§2.2 step 5), and the snapshot the client is then sent is masked for that freshly resolved role (§4.6). A widened owner gets the owner projection; a widened viewer gets the viewer projection. There is no path by which a widening can deliver a frame masked for a role the user no longer (or does not yet) hold.

**Failure modes are all delays, and MYR-601 had to BUILD the thing that bounds them.** A dropped publish, a nil seam (dev mode, or a deployment with no bus), or a user who is simply offline all cost the same thing — but the ≤60s bound every earlier paragraph reached for did not exist: the `ws.AccessRevalidator` sweep only narrowed, so an unannounced widening had no backstop and cost the car for the whole life of the session.

**The sweep therefore gained a THIRD ARM (`internal/ws/access_widen_backstop.go`).** It already re-derives every connected user's access set from the database once an interval; the gained vehicles are that same answer read in the other direction. When the freshly resolved set holds a vehicle the SESSION does not (`Client.vehicleIDs`, the handshake-frozen set `subscribe` is gated on), it calls the same `Hub.WidenUserAccess` with reason `revalidation_backstop` — the same `4002` re-handshake, no new query, no new topic, no new frame. Three arms, ordered by what they cost the session: a **lost** vehicle closes it, a **gained** one closes it too but only to hand the user more, and a **tier** change keeps it open (§4.5.3's re-mask). A session that both lost and gained is closed once, by the loss, and its reconnect resolves both. Once per USER per pass, because a widening closes every session that user holds.

**Bounds a consumer can rely on, for the GAIN direction:**

| Case | Bound |
|---|---|
| One of the five producers above, same instance (the deployment today: one Fly machine) | **sub-millisecond**, via the publish |
| That publish dropped by bus backpressure, or a nil seam | **≤ 60s**, via the sweep's widen arm — reading from the database, so it needs nobody to have announced anything |
| A writer in ANOTHER PROCESS — the Next.js app inserts `"Vehicle"` rows directly (`react-frontend` `sync.ts`), reaching neither this process's access cache nor its bus | **≤ 60s + the 5-minute access-cache TTL**, because the sweep's own resolver reads through that cache and no bust ever happened for it. Bounded, not fast; nothing in this process can publish for a writer outside it |

None of them can produce a wrong answer, and no user-facing response waits on any of it.

### 4.6 Per-role projection at broadcast (NFR-3.19)

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.19, NFR-3.20, FR-5.4. Per-resource mask matrix is canonical in [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) §5.2; the same matrix governs both transports.

NFR-3.19 requires every WebSocket broadcast to be projected through the recipient's role mask before sending. To satisfy this without per-client marshaling cost, the hub MUST pre-marshal **once per role per frame**, then fan out the role-appropriate bytes to each subscribed client based on that client's per-vehicle role:

```
EventBus -> Hub.Broadcast(vehicleId, plaintext)
  framesByRole := { for each role in v1Roles:
      role -> marshal(mask.Apply(plaintext, mask.For(resourceType, role)))
  }
  for each client subscribed to vehicleId:
      role := client.vehicleRoles[vehicleId]   // resolved at handshake (§2.2)
      client.enqueue(framesByRole[role])
```

Marshal cost is `O(|roles|)` per frame, fan-out is `O(|clients|)`. With v1's two-role matrix (`owner`, `viewer`) this is essentially free; FR-5.5's future `limited_viewer` makes it `O(3)`.

The mask matrix is the **same matrix used by the REST handler layer** (`rest-api.md` §5.2) — a single source-of-truth per resource type. The Go implementation lives in `internal/mask/` and is consumed by both the WS hub and the REST handlers (`rest-api.md` §5.1 handler-layer rule). This keeps owner/viewer behavior identical across transports and gives `contract-guard` a single set of mask tables to validate against the schema.

`Client.vehicleRoles map[VehicleID]Role` is populated at handshake time alongside `Client.vehicleIDs`. The `Authenticator.ResolveRole(ctx, userId, vehicleId)` interface method returns the role for each owned vehicle. Like `vehicleIDs`, `vehicleRoles` is a snapshot, and it is refreshed the same way: not in place, but by ending the connection so the reconnect re-derives both together (§4.5.1). Losing a grant tears the session down and the new handshake resolves roles fresh, so there is no stale role left to project through. What remains a snapshot is a role that WIDENS mid-connection — see §10 DV-09 for why that direction is left to reconnect.

**Empty-payload suppression.** If a role's mask projection leaves nothing of substance, the hub MUST omit the frame for that role rather than send a `vehicle_update`. Sending it would leak "something happened on this vehicle" to a viewer who shouldn't even know the field existed.

**"Nothing of substance" is NOT "zero keys" — MYR-435.** This rule was originally implemented as `len(projected) == 0`, and that implementation could not fire on the shape production actually emits. The broadcast path injects `lastUpdated` into every non-nav frame **before** masking, and `lastUpdated` is viewer-visible (a viewer must be able to tell live from stale). So a frame carrying only owner-only deltas did not project to zero fields for a viewer — it projected to exactly one, `{"lastUpdated": …}`, the gate never fired, and the frame went out.

The values were masked; **the frame timing was not**. A `mediaNowPlayingElapsedMs` tick alone became a beacon pulsing only while audio plays — precisely the "someone is listening right now" occupancy signal that withholding the media block exists to prevent. Lock, trunk and climate deltas are the same tell. Masking values while forwarding their timing defeats the point of masking.

The predicate is therefore: **does the projection carry at least one field that is an observation of the vehicle?** A projection consisting solely of envelope keys — keys describing the frame rather than the car — MUST be suppressed. The envelope-key set is defined in `internal/mask` (`mask.IsSubstantive`) rather than in the ws package, deliberately: it is the same place the role allow-lists live, so the two cannot drift. Today the set is exactly `lastUpdated`.

A key qualifies as envelope only if it is viewer-visible **and** its value is a property of the delivery rather than an observation of the car. `status`, `chargeLevel` and `vehicleId` do not qualify — each is a legitimate one-field frame.

This applies to **both** WS delivery paths through the same predicate: the live broadcast (`buildRoleFrames`) and the connect-time snapshot replay (`enqueueSnapshotFrame`, §2.4), which sets `ungrouped["lastUpdated"]` before projecting and so had the identical latent hole. It is applied for **all** roles, not just viewers: a frame saying only "the timestamp changed" informs nobody. That cannot regress owners, because the broadcast path returns early when there are no real fields to send, before `lastUpdated` is added.

#### 4.6.1 What a `viewer` receives on `vehicle_update` (MYR-435)

> **Client decision, 2026-08-02 ([MYR-435](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-435)):** *"Remove media/cabin and any vehicle controls."*

The viewer arm of the `vehicle_state` mask is an **explicit allow-list**, not "owner minus `vin`". The [MYR-427](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-427) privacy audit found the subtraction shape was itself the defect: every field added to the owner list reached viewers by default. The full enumeration — kept and withheld, with per-group reasoning — is canonical in [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) §5.2.1.1 and is **not duplicated here**, because two copies of a field list is how the two transports would drift.

What matters at this layer:

- **A viewer receives** location/heading/speed, the navigation group and route/trail, vehicle identity (incl. `licensePlate`, excl. the full `vin`), charge and charging state, availability (`status`, `rideShareEnabled`, `serviceEstimatedEndAt`), and `lastUpdated`. **`setupState` ([MYR-491](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-491)) is in both role allow-lists in the shared mask table but is NOT a WebSocket field at all** — no frame builder emits the key, on either transport, including the connect-time replay. It is REST-read-time only (rest-api.md §7.0/§7.1), for a reason that is structural rather than an omission: a vehicle carrying a setup state is by definition not sending telemetry frames, so there is no live update to attach it to, and its inputs change on reconciler passes and owner actions rather than on frames. The allow-list entries exist so the classification is recorded and the partition test is satisfied, not because anything streams it.
- **A viewer receives NO** media/now-playing field, **no** cabin-climate field (including `interiorTemp` and `exteriorTemp`), and **no** vehicle-controls state (`locked`, `chargePortDoorOpen`, `frunkOpen`, `trunkOpen`, `virtualKeyPaired`).
- **Absent, not nulled.** A withheld field's JSON key is omitted from `payload.fields` entirely. Emitting `null` would tell the viewer the field exists. `vehicle_update.fields` is a sparse map by contract (§4.1), so a consumer decoding a frame needs no change for this — unlike the REST snapshot, whose generated bindings do (see `rest-api.md` §5.2.1.2).
- **One table, both transports.** The hub's `buildRoleFrames` (`internal/ws/hub_masked.go`), the connect-time snapshot replay `enqueueSnapshotFrame` (`internal/ws/snapshot.go`), and the REST `/snapshot` handler all resolve `mask.For(ResourceVehicleState, role)`. There is no WS-specific matrix. Each surface is pinned by a test that drives that surface end-to-end and iterates `mask.OwnerOnlyVehicleStateFields()`, so a per-surface branch cannot be added without failing one: `TestBroadcaster_CabinOnlyTelemetry_SendsViewerNothing` (live broadcast, via the real `Broadcaster`), `TestHub_SendSnapshot_ViewerReplayOmitsEveryOwnerOnlyField` (connect-time replay), and `TestVehicleSnapshotHandler_ViewerSnapshotOmitsEveryOwnerOnlyField` (REST, in `internal/telemetry`).

Note the **connect-time snapshot replay** specifically (§2.4): it is a WS path that carries snapshot-sourced fields, so it is the one place where "the socket is masked" and "the snapshot is masked" have to be the same statement. It is, because it calls the same table.

## 5. Client -> server message catalog

> **Anchored:** FR-6.1, FR-6.2, NFR-3.21.

### Catalog summary

| `type` | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------|
| `auth` | **Implemented** | [`handler.go:authenticateClient`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) | The ONLY client->server frame the server reads today. |
| `subscribe` | **Implemented** ([MYR-46](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-46)) | [`control_frames.go:handleSubscribeFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go) | Adds the vehicle to the active subscription set after an ownership check. Non-owned target → typed `vehicle_not_owned` error and **the connection stays open** (changed by MYR-373; it used to close 4002). A session already revoked mid-connection is refused outright and its readPump exits. `sinceSeq` parsed but ignored (DV-02). |
| `unsubscribe` | **Implemented** ([MYR-46](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-46)) | [`control_frames.go:handleUnsubscribeFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go) | Removes the vehicle from the active subscription set without closing the socket. Idempotent. |
| `ping` | **Implemented** ([MYR-46](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-46)) | [`control_frames.go:handlePingFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go) | Server responds with `pong` echoing the nonce. RFC 6455 transport-level PING/PONG continues to be handled transparently by `coder/websocket`. |

As of MYR-46 the server's `readPump` ([`client.go:readPump`](../../internal/ws/client.go)) dispatches `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, and `ping` frames via [`control_frames.go:handleClientFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go). Unknown frame types are logged-and-ignored so a future SDK introducing a new client→server frame does not poison an otherwise-healthy connection.

### 5.1 `auth`

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/AuthPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixture:** `auth.json` (planned)

```jsonc
{
  "type": "auth",
  "payload": {
    "token": "<opaque session token>"
  }
}
```

| Field | Classification | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| `token` | **P1** | Never log. See [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §2.2 and the `AuthPayload.token` row in the JSON Schema (`x-classification: P1`). |

See §2.2 for full handshake semantics.

### 5.2 `subscribe`

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/SubscribePayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Implementation:** [`control_frames.go:handleSubscribeFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go)

Implemented by [MYR-46](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-46) (DV-07 RESOLVED minus `sinceSeq`). At handshake time, the server seeds the active subscription set from `Authenticator.GetUserVehicles(userID)` so a client that never sends `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` keeps receiving every owned vehicle (backwards-compatible with pre-MYR-46 SDK consumers). After handshake, an explicit `subscribe` adds a vehicle to the active set after an ownership check; a non-owned target yields a typed `vehicle_not_owned` error frame plus close code 4002 (§6.1.1, §6.2). The `sinceSeq` field is parsed but ignored — the snapshot-resume path depends on DV-02 (envelope `seq`) landing first.

**Snapshot unicast on subscribe ([MYR-137](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-137), see DV-20).** Both the implicit auto-subscribe at handshake and every explicit `subscribe` frame trigger `Hub.sendSnapshot` ([`snapshot.go`](../../internal/ws/snapshot.go)), which fetches the persisted `Vehicle` row via `VehicleSnapshotReader` and unicasts it to that one client (never fan-out) as one `vehicle_update` per atomic group present, plus one for the ungrouped individual fields (`model`, `year`, `color`, `fsdMilesSinceReset`, etc.) — never combined into a single frame, so the §3.2 atomic-group rule holds. This exists alongside, not instead of, the §7.2/§7.3 REST-snapshot-on-reconnect flow: REST remains the SDK's documented cold-load/reconnect source, but a WS-only consumer that skips the REST fetch (e.g. a bare debugging client) now also converges on the full known state immediately, instead of waiting indefinitely for Tesla to re-emit fields that only change on value-delta (`estimatedRange`, `fsdMilesSinceReset`) or never flow over the wire at all (`model`, `year`, `color`, which are DB-only and have no Tesla source).

```jsonc
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "sinceSeq": 4271
  }
}
```

When DV-02 lands, the server response to a `subscribe` carrying `sinceSeq` will be either:

- A normal `vehicle_update` stream starting at `sinceSeq + 1`, OR
- An `error` frame with `code: snapshot_required` indicating the client must perform a full REST snapshot fetch (NFR-3.11) and reconnect.

Today the server ignores `sinceSeq` and continues the existing live stream from the current state.

### 5.3 `unsubscribe`

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/UnsubscribePayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Implementation:** [`control_frames.go:handleUnsubscribeFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go)

Implemented by [MYR-46](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-46). Removes the vehicle from the per-client active subscription set without closing the underlying WebSocket. Idempotent: removing an already-absent vehicleId is a no-op. Does NOT require ownership — a subscribed-but-since-revoked vehicle is still removable so the client can drain the set on logout.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "unsubscribe",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef"
  }
}
```

### 5.4 `ping`

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/PingPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Implementation:** [`control_frames.go:handlePingFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go)

Implemented by [MYR-46](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-46). The server responds with a `pong` frame echoing the nonce so the client can compute round-trip latency. Application-level `ping` is reserved for platforms where the WebSocket library does not expose RFC 6455 PING/PONG — specifically watchOS extended-runtime sessions and iOS background sockets per NFR-3.36 / NFR-3.36a-d. Browser/Node clients still rely on transport-level RFC 6455 PING/PONG (handled transparently by [`coder/websocket`](https://github.com/coder/websocket)) and the server's outbound `heartbeat` frames (§7.4) for liveness.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "ping",
  "payload": {
    "nonce": "<opaque round-trip ID>"
  }
}
```

The server response is a `pong` frame echoing the nonce. `pong` is canonical in [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/PongPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json); the server-side write path is `control_frames.go:writePong`.

| `permission_denied` | **PLANNED** — generic 403 surface; the vehicle-specific case is now `vehicle_not_owned` (MYR-46). | server->client | Surface to UI; do not auto-retry the same vehicle | Reserved for future non-vehicle-scoped permission failures (e.g., role downgrade mid-session). |
| `vehicle_not_owned` | **Implemented** ([MYR-46](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-46)) — emitted on a `subscribe` to a vehicle outside the caller's ownership set. **No close accompanies it (MYR-373).** | server->client | Surface to UI; drop that vehicleId from the local subscription set; do not auto-retry it. **The connection remains usable** — keep using it for the vehicles that did subscribe. | The specific case of `permission_denied` for an explicit `subscribe` (§5.2). Pairing it with a close used to be the contract; that made a post-revocation client, whose stale local state still lists the lost vehicle, reconnect → subscribe → get closed → reconnect forever. Refusing one subscription is not grounds for destroying a session that may legitimately carry other vehicles. |
| `rate_limited` | **Implemented for pre-auth per-IP cap** ([`handler.go`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) emits the typed REST envelope on HTTP 429 — MYR-47); **PLANNED** for the post-auth per-user breach (DV-08) | server->client (per-user breach, paired with close 4003) OR HTTP 429 on upgrade (per-IP breach) | Auto-retry with **extended** backoff -- see pseudocode below. | Caller-facing signal: a concurrent-connection cap was breached. Per-user breach (post-auth, close 4003) and per-IP breach (pre-auth, HTTP 429) are both surfaced to the caller as the same typed error `rate_limited`; the SDK may inspect the underlying transport status for diagnostic logging but MUST NOT branch consumer-visible behavior on it. See §1.3 for the cap defaults, enforcement points, and the `rate_limited.device_cap` sub-code for the per-user breach. |
| `internal_error` | **PLANNED** | server->client | Auto-retry with backoff | Catch-all for unexpected server failures during a live session. |
| `snapshot_required` | **PLANNED** (DV-02) | server->client | Run the reconnect sequence (§7.2): re-fetch REST snapshot and restart live stream. | Server cannot satisfy the client's `subscribe.sinceSeq` request because the gap is too large. Requires DV-02 (`seq`) to ship. |
| `conflict` | **REST-only** (MYR-174) — the WS transport never emits it. | n/a (REST 409) | n/a for WS | Member of the shared `ErrorPayload.code` enum for single-union SDK typing (same rationale as `not_found`/`invalid_request`). Emitted only over REST as HTTP 409 when a ride-request state mutation is illegal from the row's current lifecycle state (see [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) §7.8 transition matrix). |

The PLANNED codes are reserved in the AsyncAPI spec and JSON Schemas today so SDKs can match against them once the server emits them. The schema enum is the canonical list -- when a new code is added, the enum, this table, and the contract-guard rules MUST all be updated in the same PR.

> **`service_unavailable` is NOT in this catalog and MUST NOT be added to it.** It is a REST-only member of the shared `ErrorPayload.code` enum's sibling catalog ([`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) §4.1.1) and is deliberately excluded from `ErrorPayload.code` itself: the WebSocket analogue of a 503 is a **close code**, not a typed frame. [MYR-612](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-612) made the REST surfaces emit `503 service_unavailable` for an unanswerable user-existence probe and gave the WS handshake close code `1013` for the same condition (§2.4, §6.2), precisely so no shipped SDK's generated union had to decode a member it does not carry.

##### `rate_limited` reconnect pseudocode

```
// On receipt of error.code == "rate_limited" (or HTTP 429 on upgrade),
// the SDK MUST use this backoff curve instead of the §7.1 default.
onRateLimited(source, subCode):
    // source ∈ {per_user_close_4003, per_ip_http_429}
    // subCode ∈ {device_cap, null}
    if subCode == "device_cap":
        // Terminal-ish: device 6+ on a 5-cap. Do NOT retry automatically;
        // surface a typed UI signal so the user can sign out another device.
        emit UI event "device_cap_reached" { userVisible: true }
        return DO_NOT_RETRY

    // All other rate_limited variants: extended exponential backoff.
    attempt       += 1
    baseDelay     := §7.1 curve[attempt]           // e.g. 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ...
    minDelay      := max(baseDelay, 2 * §7.1 curve[1])  // skip the 1s slot
    elapsedSince  := now - firstRateLimitedAt

    if source == per_user_close_4003 AND elapsedSince < 60s:
        // First minute after a per-user cap breach: pin to the §7.1 max delay
        // to avoid pounding the cap while another device releases its slot.
        delay := §7.1 maxDelay
    else:
        delay := minDelay + jitter(±20%)

    scheduleReconnect(delay)
```

> **`rate_limited.device_cap` sub-code.** When the server emits `error.code == "rate_limited"` specifically because the caller breached the **per-user** cap (§1.3, default 5 concurrent connections per user), the error frame MUST carry an additional `subCode: "device_cap"` field. SDKs MUST surface this as a typed UI signal (e.g., `DeviceCapReachedError`) distinct from generic rate-limiting, so consumer apps can render an actionable message ("Too many devices signed in -- sign out of another device to continue") instead of a misleading "Network busy, retrying..." toast. Per-IP breaches (HTTP 429 on upgrade) do NOT carry a sub-code because the SDK cannot distinguish a NAT-mate flood from user intent. This is the single deviation from the "SDK MUST NOT branch consumer-visible behavior on cap source" rule: a `device_cap` sub-code is an explicit opt-in for per-user clarity.

### 6.2 WebSocket close codes

> **Anchored:** RFC 6455 §7.4. Application-specific codes use the 4000-4999 range.

The Go server uses [`coder/websocket`](https://github.com/coder/websocket) status constants. Today the server explicitly closes the socket with the following codes:

| Code | Name | Today | Source (Go) | When | SDK reconnect policy |
|------|------|-------|-------------|------|----------------------|
| `1001` | Going Away | **Implemented** | [`client.go:writePump`](../../internal/ws/client.go) line 56 (`websocket.StatusGoingAway`) | Hub closed the client's send channel (server shutdown) | Auto-reconnect with backoff (C-6 + D-4) |
| `1008` | Policy Violation | **Implemented** | [`handler.go:refuseHandshake`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) (`websocket.StatusPolicyViolation`) | Authentication failed (sent immediately after the one `error` frame) | Branches on the preceding `error.code` -- see below |
| `1013` | Try Again Later | **Implemented** ([MYR-612](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-612)) | [`handler.go:refuseHandshake`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) (`websocket.StatusTryAgainLater`) | The fail-closed user-existence probe behind `ValidateToken` could not be ANSWERED — a pool wait, a statement timeout, a cancelled peer sharing the coalesced lookup. **NO error frame precedes it**, deliberately: `service_unavailable` is not a member of `ErrorPayload.code`, and this close code IS the WS analogue of the REST `503` ([`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) §3.2.1). | **Auto-retry with backoff, keeping the credential.** A client MUST NOT treat this as an auth failure: it must not discard the session, burn its refresh token, or route the user to a sign-in screen. |
| `1000` | Normal Closure | Tolerated | n/a | Client closed the socket cleanly | n/a (client-initiated) |

> **Divergence (DV-06):** Close code 1008 is emitted for BOTH `auth_failed` (terminal, do-not-retry) and `auth_timeout` (transient, auto-retry). The SDK has to disambiguate by reading the preceding `error.code`, which is fragile if the error frame fails to arrive. Target: map `auth_timeout` to its own close code (proposal: 4001 "Auth Token Expired" or a dedicated 40xx value once DV-06 is resolved).

In addition, RFC 6455 reserves codes 4000-4999 for **application-specific** usage. The following application-specific codes are **PLANNED** (reserved by this contract for future server emission). SDKs SHOULD recognize them but MUST NOT panic on receipt of any 4xxx code they don't know.

| Code | Name | When | SDK reconnect policy |
|------|------|------|----------------------|
| `4001` | Auth Token Expired | Server detected mid-session token expiry (e.g., JWT `exp` passed) OR client needs to refresh before reconnect (DV-06 target) | Refresh token via `getToken()`, reconnect |
| `4002` | Permission Revoked | **A vehicle access set changed while connected.** Several producers, one indistinguishable frame: the Vehicle row was deleted (MYR-73), the caller's share grant was **revoked** or **suspended** (MYR-373, §4.5.1), a car was **taken from them by its real owner** (MYR-599/MYR-601, §4.5.3), or their set **GREW** — a share extended onto them (MYR-609, §4.5.2), or a car provisioned, redeemed, un-suspended or ride-joined (MYR-601, §4.5.3). The server deliberately does not say which, and the widening case is why the name is now the weaker half of this row: the *client contract* below is what the code means, and it is correct for all four. A client is not told whether the car went away, the owner cut them off, or they gained one — it reconnects and finds out. | **Reconnect, then render whatever the new handshake returns.** The reconnect is the refresh: it re-derives the access set and the per-vehicle roles, so a caller who lost one of several vehicles comes back with the rest. Do NOT auto-retry a `subscribe` for the specific vehicleId that was open — if it is still in the reduced set the handshake covers it, and if it is not, retrying is a loop. |
| `4003` | Server Overload | Per-vehicle or per-user backpressure cap exceeded | Auto-reconnect with extended backoff |
| `4004` | Protocol Violation | Client sent a malformed frame or violated the atomic-group contract | Surface to UI as a bug; do not auto-retry |
| `4005` | Snapshot Required | Server cannot satisfy the requested `subscribe.sinceSeq` (gap too large) -- client must re-fetch the REST snapshot (paired with `error.code = snapshot_required`) | Run the standard reconnect sequence (§7.2) |

The mapping between `error.payload.code` and the close code, when both are emitted:

| `error.code` | Following close code today | Target close code |
|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| `auth_failed` | `1008` Policy Violation | `1008` (no change) |
| *(none — the probe was unanswerable)* | `1013` Try Again Later | `1013` (no change) — the close code IS the signal; see the row above |
| `auth_timeout` | `1008` Policy Violation | `4001` Auth Token Expired (DV-06) |
| `permission_denied` | n/a today | `4002` Permission Revoked (DV-07) |
| `vehicle_not_owned` | **none, deliberately** (MYR-373) | **none** — the error frame is the whole answer |
| `rate_limited` | HTTP 429 on upgrade (DV-08) | `4003` Server Overload (DV-07/DV-08) |
| `snapshot_required` | n/a today | `4005` Snapshot Required (DV-02) |
| `internal_error` | n/a today | `1011` Internal Error |

### 6.3 No P1 in error messages

Per [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §2.2 and Rule CG-DC-2: the `error.payload.message` field is **P0**, but error message construction sites MUST NOT include P1 values (no GPS, no addresses, no tokens, no email, no full VINs). Use opaque IDs (vehicleId, driveId, userId) for correlation, or `redactVIN()` for VINs that absolutely must appear.

The current implementation in [`handler.go:sendError`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) emits only static strings (`"invalid token"`, `"failed to load vehicles"`) and is therefore compliant. Future error codes MUST preserve this property; contract-guard Rule CG-DC-2 blocks PRs that introduce P1 values into error construction sites.

## 7. Heartbeat, reconnect, and snapshot resume

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.10, NFR-3.11, NFR-3.12, NFR-3.13, FR-8.1.

### 7.1 Reconnect backoff parameters (NFR-3.10)

These are the canonical values from [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.4 and MUST be implemented identically in both SDKs:

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Initial delay | 1 second | First reconnect attempt after disconnect |
| Backoff multiplier | 2x | Each subsequent attempt doubles the delay |
| Maximum delay | 30 seconds | Cap regardless of attempt count |
| Jitter | ± 25% of computed delay | Prevents thundering herd at the 5K concurrent client target (NFR-3.6) |
| Maximum retries | Unlimited (default) | SDK retries indefinitely unless `USER_STOPPED` or consumer configures a limit |

```
delay          = min(initialDelay * 2^(attempt - 1), maxDelay)
jitter         = delay * random(-0.25, +0.25)
effectiveDelay = delay + jitter
```

### 7.2 Reconnect sequence

The full sequence diagram is in [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §5. The protocol-relevant invariants:

1. **Snapshot before stream (NFR-3.11).** On reconnect, the SDK MUST re-fetch the REST snapshot ([`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) `GET /vehicles/{id}/snapshot`) BEFORE processing any new WebSocket frames. The snapshot is the cold-load source of truth; the WebSocket stream resumes from the consistent baseline.
2. **All groups -> loading.** When the SDK begins the reconnect, every `dataState` group transitions to `loading` (state-machine D-7). Cached values remain visible per NFR-3.12 / NFR-3.13.
3. **No forced reload (NFR-3.12, NFR-3.13).** The reconnect is entirely SDK-internal. The UI is never asked to refresh. Cached state remains visible indefinitely.
4. **Ordering guarantee.** Live frames received during the snapshot fetch are queued and applied AFTER the snapshot, NEVER before (CG-SM-4).
5. **Idempotent.** Multiple rapid disconnect/reconnect cycles MUST NOT cause duplicate snapshot fetches. The SDK cancels any in-flight fetch when a new reconnect begins.

The reconnect handshake replays §2 verbatim: open WSS, send `auth` frame, await live frames.

### 7.3 Snapshot-resume semantics (NFR-3.11)

NFR-3.11 says: "On reconnect, SDK MUST re-fetch the DB snapshot and resume live stream without user intervention."

Two valid implementations, the contract supports both:

1. **REST-snapshot resume (current v1.0 implementation).** Reconnect always fetches the full REST snapshot. No wire-level sequence numbers. Trade-off: extra HTTP round-trip on every reconnect, gaps within a single connection are invisible.
2. **Sequence-resume (PLANNED, v1.x, DV-02).** When the server emits envelope `seq`, the client passes its highest-seen `seq` as `subscribe.sinceSeq` (§5.2). The server replays missed frames OR responds with `error.code: snapshot_required` to fall back to mode 1. Trade-off: requires server-side per-connection retention of recent frames.

The SDK contract today is mode 1. The wire surface for mode 2 is reserved so v1.x can ship without a breaking change.

### 7.4 Heartbeat / keepalive

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.10 (reconnect cadence constraint).

| Direction | Cadence | Wire form | Source (Go) |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Server -> client | Default 15 seconds (configurable via `WebSocketConfig.HeartbeatInterval`; validated `> 0` in `config/validate.go` line 104) | Bare envelope `{"type":"heartbeat"}` (no `payload` key -- `omitempty`) | [`heartbeat.go:RunHeartbeat`](../../internal/ws/heartbeat.go) |
| Client -> server | On-demand `ping` (no fixed cadence; reserved for watchOS extended-runtime and iOS background sessions per NFR-3.36, MYR-46) | `{"type":"ping","payload":{"nonce":"…"}}` → server `pong` echo | [`control_frames.go:handlePingFrame`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go) |
| Transport-level (RFC 6455 PING/PONG) | Handled transparently by `coder/websocket` library | Binary control frames | Library internals |

The server pre-marshals the heartbeat message once at init (`heartbeatMessage = mustMarshal(wsMessage{Type: msgTypeHeartbeat})`) and broadcasts it via [`Hub.BroadcastAll`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 90 to ALL connected clients regardless of vehicle ownership.

#### 7.4.1 SDK liveness watchdog

The SDK uses the heartbeat as a positive liveness signal:

- Reset a watchdog timer on EVERY received frame (heartbeat, vehicle_update, anything).
- If the watchdog fires (no frame for `2 * heartbeatInterval`, default 30 s), the SDK treats it as a silent disconnect and triggers `WS_CLOSED` -> `connecting` (C-6 -> C-9).

Per Rule CG-SM-1 ([`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §7), the watchdog MUST NOT be used to mark `dataState` as `stale`. `dataState` transitions to `stale` only when the WebSocket actually closes (NFR-3.7, NFR-3.8b).

**Two-watchdog model.** The liveness watchdog described above is the **post-`auth_ok`** mechanism: it is armed on receipt of `auth_ok` and reset on every subsequent frame. Before `auth_ok` arrives, a separate **pre-`auth_ok` timer** is in effect (§2.3 rule 4) — a 6-second bound starting when the SDK hands the `auth` frame to the socket. The two timers never overlap: the pre-`auth_ok` timer is cancelled the moment `auth_ok` arrives or C-3 fires, whichever happens first; the liveness watchdog is armed at that same moment. Any "no frame" window between `connecting` and `connected` is covered by the pre-`auth_ok` timer; every "no frame" window after `connected` is covered by the liveness watchdog. Together they bound the end-user "Connecting..." banner to at most 6 s on degraded paths and bound silent data-plane stalls to at most 30 s.

#### 7.4.2 SDK MUST NOT use heartbeat for freshness

Per NFR-3.7, freshness is event-driven and not time-based. The SDK MUST NOT:

- Mark fields stale because no `vehicle_update` for that field arrived in the last N heartbeats.
- Use heartbeat cadence to derive any `dataState` transition.

The only legitimate uses of heartbeat in the SDK are: (a) reset the liveness watchdog, (b) update an internal "last frame received" timestamp for debug telemetry.

### 7.5 Apple platform suspend/resume (Swift SDK only)

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.36, NFR-3.36a-d. Detailed bindings in [`swift-lifecycle.md`](swift-lifecycle.md).

When the iOS / iPadOS / watchOS / visionOS / macOS process is suspended by the OS, `URLSessionWebSocketTask` does not deliver a close frame; the socket falls silent. The Swift SDK MUST detect liveness via the heartbeat-watchdog timeout in §7.4.1 and transition `connected -> disconnected` with a typed reason of `heartbeat_timeout` -- NOT `transport_close`. This is the only path by which a suspended-then-resumed app reaches `disconnected`.

The SDK is UI-framework-agnostic per NFR-3.35 and MUST NOT observe scene transitions itself. Consumers forward foreground transitions by calling `MyRoboTaxiClient.handleForegroundTransition()` from their app's lifecycle observer (SwiftUI `@Environment(\.scenePhase)`, UIKit `UIScene.willEnterForegroundNotification`, WatchKit `WKApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification`, or AppKit `NSApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification`). On receiving that call the SDK MUST execute the §7.2 reconnect sequence with a **first-attempt backoff bypass** (NFR-3.36a): reset retry counter to 0 and immediately attempt reconnect; if it fails, normal §7.1 backoff resumes from attempt 1.

Per-platform consumer wiring (notifications → SDK method) is enumerated in [`swift-lifecycle.md`](swift-lifecycle.md) §2 and §3.2.

For background-driven snapshot refresh (no foreground transition required), the Swift SDK MUST expose `performBackgroundSnapshotRefresh()` and `performBackgroundDriveRoutePrefetch(maxDrives:)` async methods per NFR-3.36b. Consumers register the platform-specific background-task identifiers (`BGAppRefreshTask` / `BGProcessingTask` on iOS / iPadOS / macOS / visionOS; `WKApplicationRefreshBackgroundTask` on watchOS) themselves and call those SDK methods from inside the registered handler. The SDK observes `Task.checkCancellation()` so consumer-supplied expiration handlers can cancel in-flight work cleanly.

Browser and Node consumers (TypeScript SDK) have no analogous lifecycle: `document.visibilitychange` is consumer-controlled and explicitly OUT of v1 SDK scope, and the Node event loop never suspends mid-task. This section binds Apple platforms only.

## 9. Type generation targets

### 9.1 TypeScript (via `@myrobotaxi/contracts`)

WebSocket message types are generated alongside `VehicleState` by the [contracts repo](https://github.com/myrobotaxi/contracts) — see [`vehicle-state-schema.md` §6.1](./vehicle-state-schema.md#61-typescript-via-myrobotaxicontracts) for the toolchain and codegen mechanics. Consumers get the discriminated envelope and all eight `$defs` message payload types via:

```ts
import type { WebSocketEnvelope, VehicleUpdatePayload, ErrorPayload } from '@myrobotaxi/contracts/types';
```

The previously-planned in-repo `gen-ts-ws-types` Makefile target is OBSOLETE; the contracts repo's `scripts/codegen.mjs` consumes `ws-messages.schema.json` + `ws-envelope.schema.json` directly. Schema-touching PRs in this repo must pair with a contracts-repo PR per the paired-PR convention until MYR-95 collapses schema authoring into the contracts repo.

### 9.2 Swift (AsyncAPI -> Codable structs)

Per NFR-3.34, the Swift SDK uses `Codable`/`Sendable` structs. A code generator (PLANNED) will produce one struct per `$defs` entry in [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json) plus the envelope from [`schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json). The discriminator is implemented as an enum-with-associated-values per Swift idiom.

## 10. Code ↔ spec divergences

This section is the canonical catalogue of every known gap between this contract and the current `internal/ws/` implementation (or between this contract and `requirements.md`). Every entry has a Linear follow-up title; contract-tester treats any un-catalogued divergence as a failing contract violation. The divergence IDs (DV-NN) are stable -- new divergences take the next free number; closed divergences retain their ID in the change log.

### Status legend

Read this legend before scanning the catalogue. A row's **Status** column classifies the action it requires:

| Status | Meaning | Blocks merge of this PR? | Action |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|--------|
| **RESOLVED** | Contract frozen AND implementation matches. | No | Audit-trail only; no further action. |
| **RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)** | Contract frozen; server/SDK wiring in flight. | No | Follow-up implementation issue referenced in the row. |
| **Requirement amendment pending** | Contract text is correct but `requirements.md` literal disagrees. | No | Separate `requirements.md` amendment PR -- this contract ships ahead of that PR by design (§10 rule 4). |
| **Open** | Known gap; neither contract nor implementation has landed the target. | No | Follow-up implementation issue referenced in the row. |
| **Open (reduced)** | A sub-slice of a larger `Open` divergence has been pulled out and resolved; the remainder is still open. | No | Same as `Open`; see the row for scope. |
| **New** | Divergence added in the same PR that introduces this section's row. | No | Same as `Open`. |

`contract-guard` treats any undocumented divergence as a failing contract violation -- this legend exists so a reader can tell at a glance which rows are informational (audit trail) and which are actionable (follow-ups).

### Catalogue

| ID | Status | Topic | Current behavior | Target behavior | Anchor | Proposed Linear issue title |
|----|--------|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------|------------------------------|

Tesla emits field batches in **500 ms buckets on the vehicle side**, and Fleet API `interval_seconds` has a **1-second minimum** -- sub-second emission cannot even be requested. MYR-14 (2026-04-29) re-confirmed this divergence after deciding the 500 ms window for the same reason; NFR-3.2 amendment to `requirements.md` remains pending. | **Amend NFR-3.2 in [`docs/architecture/requirements.md`](../architecture/requirements.md) from 200 ms to 500 ms.** This is a **requirement-drift divergence**, not an implementation-drift divergence: the server is correct and the requirement was authored without knowledge of Tesla's 500 ms batch floor. See §3.2.1 for the full justification. MYR-11 ships with DV-01 still marked "amendment pending"; a separate NFR-3.2 amendment PR is required to fully close DV-01. | NFR-3.2, §3.2.1 | `MYR-XX Amend NFR-3.2: nav debounce window 200 ms -> 500 ms (Tesla 500 ms bucket floor)` |
| **DV-02** | Open | Envelope `seq` + `ts` not emitted | Server has no per-connection sequence counter; no envelope-level timestamp.

Each `Client` carries a `subscribed` set seeded from `vehicleIDs` at handshake (so pre-MYR-46 SDK consumers that never send `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` keep receiving every owned vehicle). `subscribe` to a non-owned vehicle emits a typed `error` frame with `code: vehicle_not_owned` and closes the socket with **close code 4002**. `unsubscribe` removes the vehicle from the active set without closing. `ping` echoes the nonce back as `pong`.

| **DV-09** | **RESOLVED for access LOSS and, since MYR-609 + MYR-601, for access GAIN** (residual: an in-place ROLE upgrade, benign, ≤60s via the re-mask sweep) | Vehicle ownership AND role snapshot stale mid-connection | Both loss paths are now propagated mid-connection, and both land on the same `4002` / `vehicle access revoked` close — **zero wire change** in either. **(a) Vehicle deletion — [MYR-73](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-73) (2026-05-09):** the Postgres `vehicle_deleted` LISTEN/NOTIFY pipeline (Phase 1 trigger in `react-frontend`, Phase 2 listener in `internal/store/notify_listener.go`) drives `Hub.RemoveVehicle`, closing every subscribed client. **(b) Share revoke + suspend — [MYR-373](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-373) (2026-08-02):** `DELETE /api/invites/{inviteId}` and a suspending `PATCH` publish `share.access_revoked` on the in-process bus after committing and after busting the grantee's access cache; a hub dispatcher calls `Hub.RevokeUserAccess(granteeUserID, vehicleID, reason)`, which cuts the session off synchronously and then closes it. **Keyed on the GRANTEE, not the vehicle** — the owner's own stream and other viewers' streams are untouched, which is why this could not reuse `RemoveVehicle`. A 60s `ws.AccessRevalidator` sweep backstops the nudge (fails open on resolver error). Latency: sub-millisecond same-instance; ≤ ~6 min cross-instance on a multi-machine deployment (5-min access-cache TTL + one sweep) — the same per-process-cache caveat `rest-api.md` §7.5.3(a) records. **(c) Share EXTEND — [MYR-609](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-609) (2026-09-07):** the widening producer this row said did not exist. `POST /api/vehicles/{vehicleId}/share/extend` publishes `share.access_widened` after committing and after busting the grantee's cache; a hub dispatcher calls `Hub.WidenUserAccess(granteeUserID, vehicleID, reason)`, which closes ALL of that user's sessions — not the ones holding the vehicle, since a client that just gained a car is by definition not yet authorized for it — with the **same `4002` frame**, whose documented client contract ("reconnect, then render whatever the new handshake returns") is already exactly right. Zero wire change, and a widening is deliberately indistinguishable from a narrowing on the wire. Implemented as this row's own advice said to: the same close and a re-handshake, never a mutation of `Client.vehicleIDs` / `vehicleRoles`, which the broadcast fan-out reads lock-free. A SEPARATE topic from `share.access_revoked`, because one is a security action whose latency is a GPS leak and the other a convenience whose worst outcome is a reconnect's delay, and the two must not share a counter. See §4.5.2. **(d) EVERY OTHER WIDENING PRODUCER — [MYR-601](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-601) (2026-09-08):** (c) said share extend was "the first producer"; it was in fact the only one of five that announced anything, and the omission was reported from the field — a freshly linked car stayed unsubscribable for ~4 minutes while `GET /api/vehicles` showed it, because the linker's access-set cache was warm and their open session's `vehicleIDs` predated the car. Owner provisioning, the MYR-599 owner-wins transfer, §7.5.5 redeem, an un-suspending §7.5.4 `PATCH` and the §7.24 ride join all now bust the gaining user's cache and publish `share.access_widened` — **the same topic, the same `Hub.WidenUserAccess`, the same `4002` frame**, exactly as (c) instructed. The transfer additionally publishes `share.access_revoked` for the FORMER driver, which is the narrowing half of the same statement and the security-relevant one. Announced only when the set actually grew: `Inserted` for a provision (a passive re-link of an existing car announces nothing), `created` for a join, the request's own `suspended: false` for an un-suspend. §7.29's owner-approval acknowledgment announces nothing because it changes no access set — the gate holds the config push, not the row. See §4.5.3. **AND THE 60s SWEEP NOW BACKSTOPS THE GAIN DIRECTION, which it did not before.** Until MYR-601 the `ws.AccessRevalidator` only NARROWED, so every "≤60s" bound written for a widening was describing a mechanism that was not there: a dropped publish cost the car for the life of the session. The sweep gained a third arm (`internal/ws/access_widen_backstop.go`) that closes a session MISSING a vehicle its user can now see, with the same `Hub.WidenUserAccess` and the same `4002`, reason `revalidation_backstop`. **This is also the only cover for a widening writer OUTSIDE this process:** the Next.js app writes `"Vehicle"` rows straight into the shared database (`react-frontend` `sync.ts`), reaching neither this process's access cache nor its bus, so nothing here can publish for it — its bound is the sweep interval plus the 5-minute access-cache TTL, because the sweep's own resolver reads through a cache nobody busted. Bounded, not fast; recorded in `rest-api.md` §7.0, whose consumer guarantee is qualified accordingly. **Residual:** an in-place ROLE upgrade still needs a reconnect or the 60s re-mask sweep. That direction shows a client LESS than it is entitled to, never more, so it is not a security exposure. It now has exactly one live producer — a trip participant added inside an OPEN window (§7.30.4), whose `viewer` → `trip_participant` elevation lands on the MYR-602 `AccessRevalidator` re-mask within one sweep interval rather than immediately. Deliberately left there: the vehicle is already in that person's access set (a participant is always a share-holder), so a re-handshake would close every session they hold to change a tier the re-mask edits in place. | None outstanding. | NFR-3.19, NFR-3.21, FR-5.3, §4.5, §4.5.1, §4.5.2, §4.5.3, §4.6 | (No open issue.

The Go `time.Duration.String()` format is no longer emitted. `messages.go` struct field renamed from `Duration string` to `DurationSeconds float64` with JSON tag `"durationSeconds"`. `broadcaster.go:handleDriveEnded` calls `.Seconds()` instead of `.String()`.

| **DV-13** | **Requirement amendment pending** | `tripStartTime` atomic group membership | `requirements.md` NFR-3.1 lists `tripStartTime` as a member of the *navigation* atomic group. There is no Tesla field for `tripStartTime`; it is derived from the drive detector's `started_at` timestamp in [`internal/drives/`](../../internal/drives/). | **Relocate `tripStartTime` from the `navigation` group to the `drive` group** in NFR-3.1. The drive group is delivered via `drive_started` (not `vehicle_update`), so `tripStartTime` is naturally carried as `drive_started.payload.startedAt` -- see §4.2. MYR-11 ships with DV-13 still marked "amendment pending"; a separate NFR-3.1 amendment PR is required to fully close DV-13.

| **DV-14** | **New** | Slow-auth attack mitigation | Neither the per-IP nor the per-user cap (DV-08 target) defends against a slow-auth attack where each TCP connection sits under the per-IP cap but holds the 5 s `AuthTimeout` window. An attacker can still saturate the upgrade path by opening connections just below the concurrent cap and letting them idle through the auth deadline. | Add EITHER (a) a dedicated pre-auth rate-limit on upgrade *attempts* (token-bucket over a 1-minute window, independent of the concurrent-connection count), OR (b) a shortened `AuthTimeout` under load (e.g. drop from 5 s to 1 s when `hub.ipConnectionCount` for the source IP exceeds a soft threshold). Architect + security to decide which. This is a secondary mitigation to DV-08 and does not block v1 ship, but must be tracked so it is not forgotten. | NFR-3.6, §1.3 | `MYR-XX Add slow-auth attack mitigation (pre-auth upgrade rate limit OR adaptive AuthTimeout)` |
| **DV-15** | **RESOLVED** | state-machine.md C-3 trigger alignment | [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 previously defined C-3 (`connecting -> connected`) as triggered by "first data frame OR heartbeat arrives", because it was authored before `auth_ok` was pulled into v1. **Owner:** [MYR-31](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-31) (`Agent/sdk-architect`). | **RESOLVED by MYR-31.** `state-machine.md` §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED` with guard "Server sends `auth_ok` frame". §1.1 Mermaid diagram, §4.1 message catalog, §4.2 event-to-transition mapping, and §5.1 reconnect sequence diagram all updated.

Implementation: [`handler.go:sendAuthOk`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) called from `handleUpgrade` on the success path, before the readPump/writePump handoff.

| **DV-17** | **RESOLVED** | Empirical `timeToFull` unit verification | **Resolved 2026-04-22 via live capture** against the prod telemetry server during a home Level-2 charging session on VIN ending `3795`. Observed value: `1.066666841506958` as a `DoubleValue` at chargeLevel 68%. Cross-checked against the in-car "time to full" display and the per-hour kWh math (~9 kWh remaining × ~8-10 kW = ~0.9-1.1 hours). **Unit is hours (decimal double)** — the [tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme skill](../../.claude/skills/tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme/) and legacy Tesla REST `time_to_full_charge` descriptions are correct; the briefly-introduced "seconds" label caught by the MYR-11 post-freeze audit was factually wrong. Full capture + methodology in the [MYR-25 comment](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-25#comment-4f1dcee9-ab10-4039-acc5-9e7ef25c3762).

| **DV-18** | **RESOLVED** | `FieldChargeState` internal constant collision | **Resolved by [MYR-26](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-26).** The existing `FieldChargeState` constant (which mapped to proto 179 `DetailedChargeState`) has been renamed to `FieldDetailedChargeState` with internal name `"detailedChargeState"`. A new `FieldChargeState` constant now correctly maps to proto field 2 (`Field_ChargeState`) with internal name `"chargeState"`. Both constants are in `fieldMap`; the new `FieldChargeState` is intentionally not yet in `DefaultFieldConfig` — fleet API configuration is added by the DV-03 implementation PR. **Note:** [MYR-42](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-42) subsequently removed the `FieldDetailedChargeState` constant entirely (proto 179 now populates `FieldChargeState` directly), so only `FieldChargeState` remains. The collision resolution in MYR-26 stays valid; it was the right interim step. | (Resolved.) | NFR-3.1, §4.1.4 | [`MYR-26`](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-26) — Resolve FieldChargeState constant collision before DV-03 wiring |
| **DV-19** | **RESOLVED** | `chargeState` re-sourced from proto 179 (proto 2 deprecated on recent firmware) | [MYR-40](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-40) wired `chargeState` from Tesla proto field **2** (`ChargeState`) based on the documented proto schema. On 2026-04-23, empirical capture against the prod server showed that Tesla firmware ≥ 2024.44.25 (on VIN ending `3795`) accepts proto 2 in `fleet_telemetry_config` (API returns `synced: true` with `ChargeState` listed at `interval_seconds: 30`) but the vehicle **never actually emits proto 2** — even across plug/unplug transitions observed over multi-minute charging sessions. Proto 179 `DetailedChargeState` fires on the same transitions with identical enum string values. Evidence: two frames captured during an unplug/plug cycle at 03:37-03:38 UTC showed `proto179="Stopped"` then `proto179="Charging"` with `proto2="—"` (absent) in both. Tesla's public proto schema documents proto 2 as a valid field but recent firmware has silently stopped populating it in favor of proto 179. The `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill was not aware of this deprecation. | **Re-source `chargeState` from proto 179 (`Field_DetailedChargeState`)** via the `Value_DetailedChargeStateValue` oneof variant (primary) with `Value_ChargingValue` fallback for pre-2024.44.25 firmware. Wire-level behavior unchanged — enum string values are identical (`Unknown`, `Disconnected`, `NoPower`, `Starting`, `Charging`, `Complete`, `Stopped`). Resolved by [MYR-42](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-42) on 2026-04-23: `Field_ChargeState` removed from `fieldMap`, `FleetFieldChargeState` removed from `DefaultFieldConfig`, `Field_DetailedChargeState → FieldChargeState` added to `fieldMap`, `convertChargeState` consolidated to handle both oneof variants.

| **DV-20** | **RESOLVED** | `model`/`year`/`color`/`estimatedRange`/`fsdMilesSinceReset` never reached `vehicle_update` for WS-only consumers | [MYR-24](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-24) (2026-04-23) loaded these fields into `store.Vehicle` and the REST `/snapshot` response, but nothing in `internal/ws/` ever read them back out: `handleSubscribeFrame` ([`control_frames.go`](../../internal/ws/control_frames.go)) only mutated the subscription set, and `handleUpgrade` ([`handler.go`](../../internal/ws/handler.go)) sent `auth_ok` and started the pumps with no DB read in between. The live broadcast path (`mapFieldsForClient`, [`field_mapping.go`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go)) only ever translates fields present on an *incoming Tesla telemetry event* — `model`/`year`/`color` have no Tesla source at all (DB-only, per `vehicle-state-schema.md` §1.1) and so could never appear on the wire by any path, while `estimatedRange` and `fsdMilesSinceReset` only appeared after Tesla happened to re-emit them post-connect. A WS-only consumer (e.g. a bare debugging client that never calls the REST `/snapshot` endpoint from §7.2/§7.3) saw these fields as permanently absent. | **Root cause: missing broadcast-assembly step, not a persistence or field-mapper bug — MYR-24's persistence work was correct, but no subscribe-time read-back existed.** `Hub.sendSnapshot` (new `internal/ws/snapshot.go`, MYR-137) fetches the persisted row via a new consumer-site `VehicleSnapshotReader` interface (implemented by `wsVehicleSnapshotAdapter` over `store.VehicleRepo.GetByID` in `cmd/telemetry-server/adapters_snapshot.go`) and unicasts it — split into one `vehicle_update` per atomic group plus one ungrouped frame, per the §3.2 atomic-group rule — to the subscribing client only. Wired from both `handleUpgrade` (covers pre-MYR-46 auto-subscribed clients) and `handleSubscribeFrame` (covers explicit `subscribe`, including re-subscribe). A fetch error is logged and skipped rather than closing the connection, matching the resilience posture of `VINResolver` failures elsewhere in the broadcast path.

### Divergence management rules

1. **One-way door for the catalogue.** A new divergence MUST be added to this table in the same PR that introduces the gap. `contract-guard` treats an undocumented divergence between this doc and `internal/ws/` as merge-blocking drift.
2. **Closing a divergence.** When a follow-up PR fully resolves a divergence, mark the row's **Status** column as **RESOLVED** and add a one-line entry in the change log (§11) referencing the resolving PR and Linear issue. RESOLVED rows are **retained** in the table for audit-trail continuity. Do NOT reuse a DV-NN number even if its row is later deleted.
3. **RESOLVED-with-implementation-pending.** A divergence may be marked RESOLVED at the contract level (the target shape is locked and documented here) while the implementation follow-up is still in flight. In that case, the Status column carries the qualifier "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" and the row references the implementation issue. Once the implementation lands, the qualifier is dropped.
4. **Amendment divergences.** DV entries that propose to amend `requirements.md` (currently DV-01, DV-10, DV-13) carry the status "**Requirement amendment pending**" until the amendment PR lands. They MUST be resolved in one of two ways: ship the change, or land a `requirements.md` amendment PR that updates the NFR literal. "Leave it as drift forever" is not an option. MYR-11 is explicitly permitted to merge with DV-01 and DV-13 in "amendment pending" state because (a) the wire contract is already consistent with the correct values, and (b) the amendment PRs are out-of-scope for MYR-11's change footprint.

It was in fact the only one of five that announced anything, and the gap was found in the field rather than by audit: on 2026-09-06 an owner linked a second car, `GET /api/vehicles` rendered it immediately, and for **four minutes** every handshake reported the pre-link vehicle count while every `subscribe` for the new car was refused `vehicle_not_owned`. Nothing in the WS layer was wrong — the app was connected, so its access-set cache entry was warm and served the pre-link answer for the 5-minute TTL, and its open session's `vehicleIDs` had been frozen before the car existed. **The rule now: every event that adds a vehicle to a user's access set busts that user's cached set and then publishes `share.access_widened`** — the same topic, the same `Hub.WidenUserAccess`, the same `4002` frame, exactly as MYR-609's own residual note instructed the next producer. The five producers are owner provisioning (`provisioned`), the MYR-599 owner-wins transfer (`owner_transfer`), §7.5.5 redeem (`redeemed`), an un-suspending §7.5.4 `PATCH` (`unsuspended`) and the §7.24 ride join (`ride_joined`). **Each is gated on the set actually having grown**, because the announcement costs a reconnect: a provision announces only on `Inserted` (Postgres's `xmax = 0`), since AfterLink is a passive bulk sync that walks the owner's whole fleet on every re-link and would otherwise re-handshake every session they hold on each Tesla re-consent; a join announces only when it created the membership row; an un-suspend reads the REQUEST rather than the resulting row, because `suspended == false` is also true of an `allowRides`-only patch and `allowRides` has no WebSocket effect in either direction. **The transfer is two announcements, and the second is the security-relevant one:** the arriving owner is widened, and the FORMER driver — whose shares the same transaction revoked — is narrowed onto `share.access_revoked`, which until now nothing told the hub about at all, leaving them streaming a car that is no longer theirs in any sense until the TTL or the 60s sweep. `store.VehicleUpsertResult` gained `PreviousUserID` to carry that id, which the transaction's own audit row already named. **Two deliberate non-changes, both recorded so they are not read as omissions.** (1) §7.29's owner-approval acknowledgment announces nothing: the MYR-599 consent gate holds the Tesla-side config **push**, not the row, so an unacknowledged driver car is in its linker's access set from the instant it is provisioned — the widening already happened, one step earlier, and a driver car therefore widens exactly like an owner's. (2) A **trip participant add** (§7.30.4) announces nothing either, because a participant is structurally always an accepted, unsuspended share-holder on that car, so the vehicle is already in their access set; what an add changes inside an open window is their role TIER (`viewer` → `trip_participant`), which the MYR-602 `AccessRevalidator` re-masks in place within one sweep interval (≤60s). Closing every session that person holds to elevate a tier the re-mask can edit in place would trade a correct mechanism for a faster one, so the ≤60s bound stands as a known latency. **The re-delivered state carries the right mask by construction:** every widening is a re-handshake, never an in-place edit of `Client.vehicleIDs` / `vehicleRoles`, so the reconnect re-derives the access set and `ResolveRole` per vehicle together (§2.2 step 5) and the snapshot is masked for the freshly resolved role (§4.6). **Ordering is load-bearing everywhere** — bust, then publish; a re-handshake served from the stale cache comes back without the car, a no-op that looks like a fix. **REVIEW ROUND — the ≤60s backstop this entry leaned on did not exist, and now does.** The `ws.AccessRevalidator` only ever NARROWED, so every sentence of the form "and the 60-second sweep catches it" was true for a lost grant and false for a gained one. The sweep gained a WIDEN arm (`internal/ws/access_widen_backstop.go`): when a freshly resolved access set holds a vehicle the SESSION does not, it re-handshakes with the same `Hub.WidenUserAccess` and the same `4002`, reason `revalidation_backstop`, once per user per pass, ordered behind the loss arm and ahead of the re-mask. That is also the only cover for the one widening writer OUTSIDE this process — the Next.js app's direct `"Vehicle"` insert, which reaches neither this process's cache nor its bus — whose bound is one interval plus the 5-minute cache TTL. The same round narrowed EVERY grantee the owner-wins transfer revoked, not only the former driver (`queryRevokeSharesForVehicle` tombstones every third-party grant on the car; the ids now travel out of the transaction on `VehicleUpsertResult.RevokedGranteeIDs`), and made a first link of an N-car fleet announce ONCE rather than closing every session N times. **Sections updated:** anchored NFR-3.21 row, §4.5 divergence note, **§4.5.3 (new)**, §4.5.1 backstop paragraph, §4.5.2 closing note, §6.2 close-code `4002` producer list, §10 DV-09 (**(d)** added; residual narrowed to the in-window role elevation). | Claude (go-engineer) |
| 2026-08-02 | **[MYR-373](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-373): the share half of DV-09 is CLOSED — suspend and revoke now end an already-open socket instead of waiting for it to reconnect. ZERO WIRE CHANGE.** Until now the WS access set was frozen at handshake (§2.2) and nothing re-read it, so an owner who suspended or revoked a viewer stopped their REST access within the cache TTL while a viewer holding a **live** socket kept receiving viewer-masked `vehicle_update` frames — **including GPS** — for the unbounded life of that connection. That predates per-viewer share controls and was catalogued rather than fixed; what changed is that suspend became a first-class Share-tab switch whose whole promise is "location stops now", and the beta puts **strangers** on the viewer side. **Mechanism: a targeted close, not an in-place refresh.** `DELETE /api/invites/{inviteId}` and a `PATCH` that leaves the grant `suspended` publish the new **internal-only** `share.access_revoked` event (`events.ShareAccessRevokedEvent{GranteeUserID, VehicleID, Reason}`); a dispatcher calls the new `Hub.RevokeUserAccess(userID, vehicleID, reason)`, which closes the grantee's sessions for that vehicle with **`4002` / `vehicle access revoked`** — the code §6.2 has defined since MYR-73, so every deployed SDK already handles it. **Close rather than silently drop the one vehicle** because the protocol defines no per-vehicle removal frame and inventing one would be a wire change; because `Client.vehicleIDs` is read lock-free by every broadcast and mutating it mid-connection would put a write on the hottest path in the server; and because the reconnect re-derives the access set AND the per-vehicle roles in the one place that already does it correctly — which is also how the role half of DV-09 stops mattering for the loss direction. **Keyed on the GRANTEE, never the vehicle.** This is the one thing `Hub.RemoveVehicle` could not be reused for: the car is fine and still streaming to its owner, so a vehicle-keyed close would have taken the owner down over somebody else's suspension. The owner's session and other viewers' sessions are explicitly asserted untouched; an empty grantee id closes **nothing** rather than reading as a wildcard. **Two ordering/latency properties that are correctness, not polish.** (1) The cache bust must PRECEDE the notification: the close provokes the SDK's reconnect, and a handshake served from a stale access set would hand the grant straight back. (2) The session is marked cut off **synchronously** — `Client.hasVehicle`, the single choke point both `Broadcast` and `BroadcastMasked` funnel through, returns false immediately — while the close handshake runs on its own goroutine, because a graceful WebSocket close waits up to **five seconds** for the peer to echo, and both blocking the bus goroutine behind an unresponsive viewer and streaming GPS for those five seconds are unacceptable. **Backstop:** a 60s `ws.AccessRevalidator` sweep re-derives every connected user's access set from the database and closes anyone holding a vehicle they can no longer see, covering what the nudge structurally cannot — an event dropped by the bus's drop-oldest backpressure, a mutation served by another machine, a future write path that forgets to publish. It **fails open** on a resolver error, deliberately: a fail-closed sweep would turn a transient query error into a fleet-wide disconnect. **Bounds:** sub-millisecond same-instance (measured end to end over a real socket); ≤ ~6 min cross-instance on a multi-machine deployment (5-min access-cache TTL + one sweep), which is the same per-process-cache caveat `rest-api.md` §7.5.3(a) already records and is moot on today's single Fly machine. **Explicitly NOT covered, and asserted so:** `allowRides` closes nothing — it governs the §7.8 ride surface and has no WebSocket effect, so tearing down a live map over it would disconnect a viewer for a change that does not touch the live map. Lifting a suspension closes nothing either. And a capability that WIDENS mid-connection still needs a reconnect; that direction shows a client less than it is entitled to, never more. **TWO THINGS FOUND BY ADVERSARIAL REVIEW AND FIXED BEFORE MERGE, both recorded here because the first invalidates a claim an earlier draft of this entry made.** (1) **The cut-off is enforced in `Client.enqueue`, not `hasVehicle`.** The first cut guarded `hasVehicle` and called it the single choke point. It is not: `subscribe` → `Hub.sendSnapshot` → `enqueueSnapshotFrame` reaches the client without consulting it, and `handleSubscribeFrame` gates on the handshake-frozen ownership set, which still contains the revoked vehicle. A verifier reproduced live GPS `vehicle_update` frames delivered after revocation and before the 4002 close, 25/25 attempts. A second window needed no peer cooperation at all: `Register` runs before the handshake's own snapshot loop, so a revocation landing between them shipped the full snapshot anyway. The guard now sits in `enqueue` — **the only writer to a client's send channel**, so no future producer can bypass it — plus `sendSnapshot` and `handleSubscribeFrame` for early refusal. (2) **`vehicle_not_owned` on `subscribe` no longer closes the connection** (§5.2 `subscribe` row, §6.1.1, §6.2 mapping table, all updated). That close was harmless when nothing ever revoked a live socket; once revocation started closing sockets it became a server-driven reconnect loop — the viewer reconnects, re-handshakes into the correctly reduced set, re-sends the `subscribe` its stale local state still lists, and is closed again, forever. The typed error already tells the client what happened; destroying an otherwise-valid session that may carry other vehicles does not. The client half is [MYR-432](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-432). **This is the one wire-visible behavior change in MYR-373** — a strict relaxation (the error frame is unchanged; only the close is gone), and no decoder is affected. (3) **A THIRD ROUND caught that the cut-off in (1) had itself introduced a permanent session leak,** and it is recorded here because it is the kind of fault the fix for (1) makes easy to reintroduce: once the guard refuses every frame, nothing can ever reach a revoked client's send channel, so its write pump — which exits only on a cancelled context, a closed send channel, or a failed write — parked forever, and it gates the teardown that unregisters the session. The 15s heartbeat had been an *accidental* escape hatch (it reached the channel, the write failed on the dead connection, teardown followed); the guard removed exactly that. Every revocation would have leaked two goroutines and a permanent hub entry, inflating the connected-clients gauge for the life of the process and leaving the revalidation sweep re-examining a phantom every 60 seconds. The revocation now signals the write pump explicitly, so teardown depends on nothing arriving and nothing being acknowledged by the peer. **Sections updated:** anchored-requirements NFR-3.21 row, §2.2 step 5, §4.5 divergence note, **§4.5.1 (new)**, §4.6 role-snapshot paragraph, §5.2 `subscribe` row, §6.1.1 `vehicle_not_owned` row, §6.2 close-code `4002` row (three producers, one indistinguishable frame; guidance rewritten to "reconnect and render the new handshake") and the error→close mapping row, §10 DV-09 (**Open (reduced) → RESOLVED for access LOSS**, residual documented). | Claude (go-engineer) |
| 2026-07-25 | **MYR-270: owner-driven dispatch v2 supersedes the MYR-265 auto-leg model.** `ride_status_changed` still carries every transition with no wire-shape change (`status` was already the full `RideRequestStatus` enum). The transition producers change: the rider `board` endpoint and the `internal/ridecomplete` drive-end auto-completion are **removed**; the live transitions are now owner `accepted → arrived` (picked-up), rider `arrived → enroute` (start), owner `enroute → completed` (dropped-off). The internal-only leg-2 dispatch seam is renamed `ride.boarded → ride.started` (topic `ride.started`, `internal/events/ride_events.go`) and now fires on the rider **start** — still NO WS frame, never broadcast (mirrors `ride.accepted`). | go-engineer |
| 2026-07-25 | **MYR-265: `ride_status_changed` gains two new live transitions — `accepted → enroute` (rider board) and `enroute → completed` (drive-end).** No wire-shape change: `status` was already typed as the full `RideRequestStatus` enum, so `enroute`/`completed` flow through the existing §4.8 frame for free (per-party unicast, summary-only). New internal-only `ride.boarded` event (topic `ride.boarded`, `internal/events/ride_events.go`) carries the P1 dropoff place for the leg-2 Tesla `navigation_request` push — NO WS frame, never broadcast (mirrors `ride.accepted`). Completion is driven by `internal/ridecomplete` subscribing to `drive.ended`. | go-engineer |
| 2026-07-09 | **MYR-175: owner accept/decline now emit `ride_status_changed` (stacked on MYR-174).** The §4.8 frame gains two live producers: `POST /api/ride-requests/{id}/accept` and `/decline` (rest-api.md §7.8) publish onto `ride.status.changed` after the owner's decision; delivery semantics unchanged (per-party unicast, summary-only). A successful accept also publishes the **internal-only** `ride.accepted` dispatch-seam event (topic `ride.accepted`, `internal/events/ride_events.go`) carrying the P1 places + passenger contact for MYR-176's Tesla `navigation_request` push — this event deliberately has NO WS frame and never reaches the broadcast path; the client-visible accept signal is the summary `ride_status_changed`. No wire-shape or schema changes. | go-engineer |
| 2026-07-09 | **MYR-174: ride-hailing summary frames `ride_request_created` + `ride_status_changed` (P10).** Added §4 catalog rows, §4.7/§4.8 frame references, and the per-party delivery note. Both frames are **per-party unicast** (rider + vehicle owner, by user id via the new `Hub.SendToUsers`), NOT the §4.5 vehicle-ownership-filter path — a vehicle-keyed broadcast would leak the ride to other shared viewers. Both are **summary-only** (ids + status + `scheduledFor`/`rescheduleStatus`; pickup/dropoff/passenger P1 stay off the wire, clients refetch REST detail — same rationale as `drive_ended`/DV-11). Published by the ride-request handlers (`internal/telemetry/ride_request_handler.go`) onto the `ride.request.created` / `ride.status.changed` event topics; `internal/ws/ride_broadcast.go` marshals + unicasts. Also added a §6.1.1 catalog row for the shared-enum `conflict` code (REST-only; never emitted over WS). No change to the canonical `ws-messages.schema.json` (the payloads landed there in contracts v0.9.0). | go-engineer |
| 2026-07-08 | **MYR-137: `Hub.sendSnapshot` unicasts a persisted-state snapshot on subscribe — DV-20 added and RESOLVED in the same PR.** Root cause: MYR-24 (2026-04-23) loaded `model`/`year`/`color`/`fsdMilesSinceReset` (and the pre-existing `estimatedRange`) into `store.Vehicle` and the REST `/snapshot` response, but no code path in `internal/ws/` ever read the DB row back out — `handleSubscribeFrame` only mutated the subscription set and `handleUpgrade` never queried the DB between `auth_ok` and starting the pumps. The live broadcast path only ever translates fields present on an *incoming Tesla telemetry event*, and `model`/`year`/`color` have no Tesla source at all (DB-only catalog fields), so a WS-only consumer that never calls the REST endpoint saw them as permanently absent. Fix: new `internal/ws/snapshot.go` adds `Hub.sendSnapshot`, wired from both `handleUpgrade` (pre-MYR-46 auto-subscribed clients) and `handleSubscribeFrame` (explicit `subscribe` / re-subscribe). It fetches the row via a new consumer-site `VehicleSnapshotReader` interface (`wsVehicleSnapshotAdapter` in `cmd/telemetry-server/adapters_snapshot.go`, wrapping the existing `store.VehicleRepo.GetByID`) and unicasts the result as one `vehicle_update` per atomic group present (`navigation`, `charge`, `gps`, `gear`) plus one for the ungrouped individual fields — never combined into a single frame, preserving the §3.2 "at most one atomic group per frame" rule. Because `chargeLevel` and `estimatedRange` are both members of `groupCharge` and are read from the same row, they always land in the same frame by construction. A snapshot fetch error is logged and skipped (non-fatal), matching the existing `VINResolver` failure posture elsewhere in the broadcast path. No wire-shape change — `vehicle_update`'s envelope and per-field types are unchanged; this closes a broadcast-assembly gap, not a schema gap. Added §5.2 prose describing the new behavior alongside the existing REST-snapshot-on-reconnect flow (§7.2/§7.3), which remains the SDK's documented cold-load source. | go-engineer |
| 2026-04-13 | Initial full draft (closed PR #166): handshake, envelope, server->client and client->server catalogs, error/close-code matrix, heartbeat/reconnect/snapshot semantics, AsyncAPI 3.0 spec, sibling JSON Schemas, §10 open questions. Authored by a general-purpose agent role-playing `sdk-architect`; closed by the user for re-do with the real subagent. | general-purpose (role-played) |
| 2026-04-13 | **Authoritative rewrite by the registered `sdk-architect` subagent.** (1) Corrected the anchored-requirements table: fixed FR-8.1/FR-8.2 labels, added FR-7.3, NFR-3.9, NFR-3.12, NFR-3.13 anchors. (2) Fixed the `MaxConnectionsPerIP` wiring claim: it is **not** populated by `main.go` today, so the per-IP cap is unwired. Recorded as DV-08. (3) Added the `charge`/`gps`/`gear` non-accumulator server flow explanation to §3.2 (only nav has a dedicated debounce). (4) Replaced §10 "open questions" with a formal "Code ↔ spec divergences" catalogue with stable DV-NN IDs and divergence-management rules. (5) Added new divergences: DV-03 (`chargeState`), DV-04 (`timeToFull`), DV-06 (`auth_timeout` close-code conflation), DV-10 (`speed` ungrouped), DV-11 (`drive_ended` FR-3.4 scope split), DV-12 (`duration` string format), DV-13 (`tripStartTime`). (6) Tightened §6.1.1 to separate today/planned + reconnect policy columns, added `snapshot_required` reserved code. (7) Added forward-compat open-object rule to §3.1 for FR-1.3. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-13 | **v1 contract freeze (second pass).** Specialist decisions from `tesla-telemetry`, `security`, `sdk-typescript`, `sdk-swift` applied: **DV-01** recast as requirement-drift (NFR-3.2 literal 200 ms is wrong; Tesla 500 ms bucket + 1 s `interval_seconds` minimum is the floor; NFR-3.2 amendment pending). **DV-03, DV-04 RESOLVED** -- `chargeState` (proto field 2, enum) and `timeToFull` (proto field 43, double seconds) added to the v1 charge atomic group; `vehicle-state-schema.md` line 333 factually-wrong "not available from Tesla Fleet Telemetry" claim corrected. **DV-08 RESOLVED** (target documented; wiring still pending): both caps ship with asymmetric enforcement -- per-IP 64 (pre-auth, HTTP 429) + per-user 5 (post-auth, error frame + close 4003). **DV-11 RESOLVED** -- summary on wire + `fetchDrive(driveId)` SDK helper (unanimous SDK recommendation). **DV-12 RESOLVED** -- `duration` string dropped, `durationSeconds` number replaces it. **DV-13** recast as requirement-drift (`tripStartTime` relocated from navigation group to drive group; carried as `drive_started.payload.startedAt`; NFR-3.1 amendment pending). **auth_ok** pulled out of DV-07 and made v1-required (new §2.3 content; C-3 trigger is now `auth_ok` receipt; rest of DV-07 remains open for `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`ping`/`pong` + typed `permission_denied`). **New divergences added:** **DV-14** (slow-auth attack mitigation follow-up to DV-08) and **DV-15** (`state-machine.md` C-3 trigger alignment follow-up). Cross-contract updates to `vehicle-state-schema.md` §2.2 and §7.1. AsyncAPI spec + `ws-envelope.schema.json` + `ws-messages.schema.json` updated in lockstep. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-13 | **PR #167 review pass.** Addresses Claude Review warnings (3) and ux-audit + Claude Review nice-to-haves (7). (1) Updated DV-03, DV-04, DV-12 Status column to "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" to match the §10 Rule 3 qualifier convention that DV-08 already uses. (2) Added **DV-16** for the `auth_ok` frame emission gap: server has zero `auth_ok` references in `internal/ws/` today, so an SDK that implements §2.3 rule 4 literally will hit its 6-second pre-`auth_ok` timer on every connection. DV-16 status is "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)". (3) Updated the §4 catalog `auth_ok` row Source cell from the clever-paren rationale to a plain `(target; see DV-16)` reference. (4) Added a paragraph after §3.1's open-object rule clarifying that `additionalProperties: false` in the JSON Schemas is the contract-tester invariant, not a runtime SDK rule. (5) Added a perceptual-smoothness scope note to §3.2.1 explaining the 500 ms debounce applies only to the nav group and that GPS/position updates arrive on Tesla's per-field cadence, independent of nav. (6) Added a C-3 inline gloss to §2.3 rule 1 so a reader does not have to tab-switch to state-machine.md. (7) Added SDK type-gen guidance (`string | null` / `Optional<String>`) and null-placeholder UI prose (`--`, not a spinner) for `chargeState` / `timeToFull` in §4.1.4. (8) Added a `rate_limited` reconnect pseudocode block + a `rate_limited.device_cap` typed sub-code to §6.1.1 so per-user cap breaches surface an actionable "too many devices" UI signal instead of a generic rate-limit toast. `ErrorPayload.subCode` added to `ws-messages.schema.json` with the `device_cap` enum. (9) Added a status legend above the §10 catalogue so a reader can classify rows as `RESOLVED` / `RESOLVED (wiring pending)` / `Requirement amendment pending` / `Open` / `New` at a glance. (10) Added an audit-trail footnote under `data-classification.md` §6 "By tier" summary recording MYR-11 as the source of the P0 count bump 83 -> 85. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-16 RESOLVED by [MYR-33](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-33).** Server now emits `auth_ok` as the first frame after `Hub.Register` succeeds (`handler.go:sendAuthOk`). §4 catalog row updated from `(target; see DV-16)` to `handler.go:sendAuthOk`. §10 DV-16 status flipped from "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" to "RESOLVED". | go-engineer |
| 2026-04-14 | **Tesla SME audit corrections.** After the MYR-11 freeze commit landed, a trust-but-verify audit by the `tesla-telemetry` subagent against the `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill and the vendored `vehicle_data.proto` found three errors, all stemming from the same "claim-without-citation" failure mode that caused the original MYR-8 `timeToFull` incident. **Fix 1 — `timeToFull` unit (CRITICAL):** §4.1.4 and every cross-contract reference labeled the unit as "seconds". The SME skill documents it as **hours (decimal)** and the legacy Tesla REST API `time_to_full_charge` is also in hours. Corrected across §4.1.4, `vehicle-state-schema.md` §1.1/§2.2/§7.1, `data-classification.md` §1.3, `vehicle-state.schema.json` (added `chargeState` and `timeToFull` field definitions — the JSON Schema had NOT been updated in the previous freeze pass, a separate drift the audit also caught), and the AsyncAPI example (5400 seconds → 1.5 hours). **Fix 2 — fabricated protobuf identifier:** §3.2 and `vehicle-state-schema.md` §2.2 referenced a type name `VehicleTelemetryEvent.Fields` that does not exist in the Tesla proto. Tesla's actual top-level message is `Payload` with repeated `Datum` entries. Corrected to reference the real type. **Fix 3 — sourceless `interval_seconds` claim:** §3.2.1 claimed Tesla enforces a 1-second minimum and cited our own `fleet_api_fields.go` lines as authority. The 1-second value is OUR highest-cadence request, not a published Tesla floor. Reworded to distinguish REQUESTED cadence from the DELIVERED-as-one-message cadence (500 ms Tesla vehicle-side bucket). **New divergences added:** **DV-17** — empirical unit verification of `TimeToFullCharge` via charging-vehicle protobuf capture, required before any SDK build generates types against `timeToFull`. **DV-18** — `FieldChargeState` internal constant collision: `internal/telemetry/fields.go` already uses that name for proto 179 (`DetailedChargeState`); the DV-03 implementation PR must rename the existing constant before adding a new one for proto 2. Flagged as a Go-side trap the contract doc cannot fix on its own. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-15 RESOLVED** by MYR-31. `state-machine.md` §1.3 C-3 trigger amended from "first data frame OR heartbeat" to "receipt of `auth_ok`". Both docs now agree on the canonical C-3 trigger. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-12 RESOLVED by [MYR-32](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-32).** Server now emits `durationSeconds` (float64) instead of `duration` (Go string) on `drive_ended` frames. `messages.go` field renamed, `broadcaster.go` calls `.Seconds()` instead of `.String()`. §10 DV-12 status flipped from "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" to "RESOLVED". | go-engineer |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-18 RESOLVED by [MYR-26](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-26).** Renamed `FieldChargeState` (proto 179) to `FieldDetailedChargeState`; added new `FieldChargeState` for proto field 2 (`Field_ChargeState`). The naming collision that would have blocked DV-03 wiring is eliminated. §10 DV-18 status flipped from "New (implementation trap)" to "RESOLVED". | go-engineer |
| 2026-04-15 | **MYR-27: Rename `fsdMilesToday` to `fsdMilesSinceReset`.** Wire field name in §3.2 ungrouped list, §4.1 rename table, and §4.1.7 ungrouped field list updated. Tesla's `SelfDrivingMilesSinceReset` does not reset daily; the cosmetic label was wrong. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-21 | **MYR-28: Delineate `TimeToFullCharge` (proto 43) vs `EstimatedHoursToChargeTermination` (proto 190).** Research confirmed proto 43 is trip-aware (reports time-to-trip-ready during Trip Planner sessions, time-to-`ChargeLimitSoc` otherwise) while proto 190 always reports the simple time-to-`ChargeLimitSoc`. Decision: keep proto 43 as the `timeToFull` source because trip-awareness matches the product UX "when will my car be done charging?". Updated §10 DV-04 to cross-reference the resolved delineation in `vehicle-state-schema.md` §7.1 (the canonical location for the full comparison + citations). No wire, schema, fixture, or Go code changes — proto 43 was already the source; this PR is pure documentation closing a research question MYR-11 left open. Empirical side-by-side capture folded into DV-17 (MYR-25). | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-22 | **MYR-40: Wire `chargeState` (proto 2) + `timeToFull` (proto 43) into the live WS path.** Added `FleetFieldChargeState` to `DefaultFieldConfig`, promoted `Field_TimeToFullCharge` from MYR-25 observation-only into `fieldMap`, added `convertChargeState` routing proto 2's `Value_ChargingValue` oneof through the existing `chargingStateString` helper. `timeToFull` routes through `convertNumericOrString` (handles `DoubleValue` → `float64` hours). §4.1.4 prose updated: "Today the server requests only two of four charge fields" wording replaced with "all four fields in `DefaultFieldConfig`." DV-03 and DV-04 flipped from "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" to "RESOLVED (wire wiring live; REST snapshot DB persistence pending)" — the DB-persistence follow-up needs a cross-repo Prisma PR in `../react-frontend` since `Vehicle` is Prisma-owned. DV-17 flipped from "New (research)" to "RESOLVED" — empirical 1.0667h capture on 2026-04-22 confirmed the hours unit. Proto 190 (`EstimatedHoursToChargeTermination`) remains held out of `fieldMap` pending the MYR-28 §7.1 flip-condition Trip Planner capture tracked in MYR-25. | go-engineer + sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-23 | **MYR-42: Re-source `chargeState` from proto 179 `DetailedChargeState` (proto 2 deprecated in recent firmware).** Empirical capture on 2026-04-23 against the prod server showed Tesla firmware ≥ 2024.44.25 accepts proto 2 in `fleet_telemetry_config` (`synced: true`) but never actually emits it. Proto 179 fires on the same transitions with identical enum string values. §4.1.4 wire-table source column updated from "proto field 2 (`ChargeState`)" → "proto field 179 (`DetailedChargeState`)". Added **DV-19** as a new resolved divergence capturing the firmware-deprecation finding and switch. DV-03 resolution cell updated to reference the new source proto. Cross-contract updates to `vehicle-state-schema.md` §1.1/§2.2/§7.1, `schemas/vehicle-state.schema.json`, and `data-classification.md` §1.3. Wire-level behavior unchanged — enum strings identical across proto 179's `DetailedChargeStateValue` enum and the legacy `ChargingState` enum. `Field_ChargeState` removed from `fieldMap`; `FleetFieldChargeState` removed from `DefaultFieldConfig`; `convertChargeState` consolidated to handle both oneof variants (`DetailedChargeStateValue` primary + `ChargingValue` pre-2024.44.25 fallback). | go-engineer + sdk-architect |
| 2026-05-09 | **MYR-73 Phase 2: vehicle-deletion sub-case of DV-09 RESOLVED.** Added `Hub.RemoveVehicle(vehicleID)` driven by a Postgres `vehicle_deleted` LISTEN/NOTIFY pipeline. The Next.js trigger (cross-repo) fires on every Vehicle DELETE; the Go listener republishes as `VehicleDeletedEvent` on the in-process bus; a dispatcher fans out to the hub (close subscribed clients with 4002), the Tesla mTLS receiver (close active inbound stream), the VIN cache (evict stale identifiers), and the JWT user-existence cache (1s singleflight TTL — bounded staleness for deleted users). Receiver also rejects inbound frames for unknown VINs with HTTP 403 and the `tesla_inbound_rejected_total{reason="vehicle_not_authorized"}` counter. Role-mutation drift remains open under DV-09 (reduced). | go-engineer |
