# WebSocket Protocol Contract

**Status:** Draft -- v1
**Target artifact:** AsyncAPI 3.0 specification at [`specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml`](specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml)
**Owner:** `sdk-architect` agent
**Last updated:** 2026-04-13

## Purpose

Defines every WebSocket message exchanged between the telemetry server (`internal/ws/`) and SDK clients (TypeScript, Swift, web, mobile). This contract is the authoritative source for:

- The connection handshake (auth frame, token validation, accept/reject)
- Server->client and client->server message catalogs
- The envelope schema (type discriminator, payload, planned sequence/timestamp)
- Heartbeat cadence and close-code semantics
- Reconnection and snapshot-resume rules

The markdown is the human source of truth. Its machine-readable twin is [`specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml`](specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml). Per-message JSON Schemas live alongside in [`schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json) and [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json). Drift between this doc, the AsyncAPI spec, the schemas, and `internal/ws/` is a CI failure ([`contract-guard`](../../CLAUDE.md#merge-policy-non-negotiable)).

Known, **accepted** divergences between this contract and the current `internal/ws/` implementation are catalogued in §10. Every such entry has a Linear follow-up title. A divergence that is not listed in §10 is contract drift and MUST be fixed, not added.

## Anchored requirements

Every FR/NFR listed here is anchored in at least one section of this doc. The tag in the "Where" column is the exact section the requirement lands in.

| ID | Requirement | Where it lands |
|----|-------------|----------------|
| **FR-1.1** | Live telemetry stream: position, speed, heading, gear | §4.1 vehicle_update; §4.1.3 GPS group; §4.1.5 gear group; §4.1.7 speed (ungrouped) |
| **FR-1.2** | Live charge state: battery level, charge state, range | §4.1.4 charge group (`chargeLevel`, `chargeState`, `estimatedRange`, `timeToFull`) |
| **FR-1.3** | Architecture allows new telemetry fields without architectural change | §3.1 envelope open-object rule; §4.1.1 wire field mapping |
| **FR-2.1** | Nav: destination, ETA, distance, polyline, origin | §4.1.2 navigation group (note: `tripStartTime` relocated to `drive` group -- see DV-13 and §4.2) |
| **FR-2.2** | Nav fields delivered as an atomic group | §3.2 atomic-group rule; §4.1.2 server flow |
| **FR-2.3** | Nav cancellation clears the entire group atomically | §4.1.2 nav clear; §4.1.2 SDK amplification rule |
| **FR-3.1** | Live drive events: drive_started, drive_updated, drive_ended | §4.2 drive_started (carries `startedAt`, satisfying `tripStartTime` after DV-13 amendment); §4.3 drive_ended; §4.1.6 drive_updated (virtual wire form) |
| **FR-6.1** | SDK accepts a getToken() callback | §2.1 handshake; §2.3 `auth_ok` acknowledgement; §5.1 auth message |
| **FR-6.2** | SDK calls getToken() on initial connect and on every auth error | §2.2 auth frame; §6.1.1 auth_failed policy |
| **FR-7.1** | Typed error codes (no string-matching) | §6.1 error frame; §6.1.1 error code catalog |
| **FR-7.3** | Only terminal errors surface to UI; transient errors auto-retry | §6.1.1 reconnect-policy column; §6.2 close code matrix |
| **FR-8.1** | connectionState surface (5 states) | §2.4 connection state mapping; §7.2 reconnect sequence |
| **FR-8.2** | UI composes connectionState and dataState; SDK never collapses them | §4.1 group routing; §4.5 per-vehicle ownership filtering; §7.2 reconnect invariants |
| **NFR-3.1** | Atomic grouping of related fields | §3.2 atomic-group rule; §4.1 catalog. v1 charge group is `{chargeLevel, chargeState, estimatedRange, timeToFull}` (§4.1.4); `tripStartTime` has been relocated to the `drive` group via `drive_started.startedAt` (§4.2). NFR-3.1 literal amendment pending -- see DV-13. |
| **NFR-3.2** | Server-side debounce window for atomic-group accumulation | §3.2.1 debounce window. The canonical v1 window is **500 ms**, constrained by Tesla's 500 ms batch floor (not a server-side choice). NFR-3.2 literal currently reads 200 ms; amendment pending -- see DV-01. |
| **NFR-3.9** | Clear any field in a group → SDK applies clear to full group atomically | §4.1.2 nav clear; §4.1.2 SDK amplification rule |
| **NFR-3.10** | Reconnect with exponential backoff (1s/2x/30s/jitter) | §7.1 reconnect backoff parameters |
| **NFR-3.11** | Reconnect re-fetches DB snapshot, resumes live stream | §7.2 reconnect sequence; §7.3 snapshot-resume semantics |

## 1. Transport and URL

### 1.1 Endpoint

| Field | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Path | `/api/ws` | [`internal/ws/handler.go`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 43 |
| Production scheme | `wss://` (TLS termination at the edge, **NFR-3.22**) | Fly.io edge |
| Local dev scheme | `ws://` (allowed only when origin matches dev allow-list) | [`cmd/telemetry-server/main.go`](../../cmd/telemetry-server/main.go) |
| HTTP method | `GET` (with `Upgrade: websocket` header) | RFC 6455 §4 |
| Content type | `application/json`, framed as WebSocket text messages | [`internal/ws/client.go:writeMessage`](../../internal/ws/client.go) |
| WebSocket library | [`github.com/coder/websocket`](https://github.com/coder/websocket) (never `gorilla/websocket`, per `CLAUDE.md`) | [`internal/ws/handler.go`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 13 |

### 1.2 Origin enforcement

The server passes `HandlerConfig.OriginPatterns` (populated from `WebSocketConfig.AllowedOrigins`) to `websocket.AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns`. Requests from origins not in the allow-list are rejected with `HTTP 403` **before** the WebSocket upgrade completes. There is no in-band error frame for this case -- the client receives an HTTP error response on the upgrade attempt.

| Mode | Default | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| Production | Configured allow-list (e.g. `https://app.myrobotaxi.com`) | `cfg.WebSocket().AllowedOrigins` via env / `config.json` |
| Dev | `["*"]` (allow all) | [`cmd/telemetry-server/main.go`](../../cmd/telemetry-server/main.go) fallback when `AllowedOrigins` is empty |

### 1.3 Connection limits

v1 enforces **two** concurrent-connection caps with asymmetric policies:

| Cap | Default | Enforcement point | Breach response | Surfaced as |
|-----|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Per-IP (`HandlerConfig.MaxConnectionsPerIP`) | **64** | Pre-auth, during the HTTP upgrade | `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` (no WS handshake, no `error` frame) | HTTP status on upgrade -> SDK treats as `rate_limited` per §6.1.1 |
| Per-user (`WebSocketConfig.MaxConnectionsPerUser`) | **5** ([`internal/config/defaults.go:67`](../../internal/config/defaults.go)) | Post-auth, after `Authenticator.ValidateToken` succeeds, before `Hub.Register` | `error` frame (`code: "rate_limited"`) followed by WS close code **`4003 Server Overload`** | `error.code = "rate_limited"` + close code 4003 per §6.1.1 / §6.2 |

**Rationale.** The per-IP cap at the upgrade layer survives corporate / campus / carrier NAT (a shared egress IP is common) while still deterring single-host floods. The per-user cap prevents a compromised token from hoarding every slot in the hub; 5 concurrent sessions is enough for a user with phone + desktop + watch + tablet + a debug session without giving an attacker unbounded leverage. The per-IP cap is deliberately higher than the per-user cap because one IP routinely aggregates many legitimate users.

**Close-code choice.** Per-user breaches close with **4003 Server Overload** (reserved in §6.2) because the user IS entitled to *some* session -- they are being shed for overload-management reasons, and the SDK should auto-reconnect with extended backoff after shedding the excess. By contrast, a per-IP breach never reaches the WebSocket layer, so there is no 4xxx code to send -- the SDK observes the HTTP 429 and falls into the §7.1 reconnect backoff.

The client IP is resolved from the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` entry when present ([`internal/ws/handler.go:resolveClientIP`](../../internal/ws/handler.go)); `hub.ipConnectionCount` provides the per-IP counter and `Hub.Register` tracks per-user state.

> **Divergence (DV-08):** The target behavior above is the v1 contract. Today, [`cmd/telemetry-server/main.go`](../../cmd/telemetry-server/main.go) line 178 builds the `HandlerConfig` without populating `MaxConnectionsPerIP`, and `WebSocketConfig.MaxConnectionsPerUser` is likewise not threaded into the handler, so **neither cap is enforced yet**. The resolution is a wiring change (not a design change); tracked as DV-08 in §10.
>
> **Divergence (DV-14):** Neither cap defends against a slow-auth attack where each TCP connection sits under the per-IP cap but holds the 5 s `AuthTimeout` window. Mitigation is deferred to a follow-up: either a dedicated pre-auth rate-limit on upgrade *attempts* (not just concurrent holdings) OR a shortened `AuthTimeout` under load. Tracked as DV-14 in §10.

SDKs MUST treat both HTTP 429 on upgrade AND WebSocket close code 4003 as `rate_limited` signals, apply the reconnect backoff from §7.1 (with extended ceiling for 4003 per §6.2), and surface `rate_limited` as a typed error per FR-7.1.

  |<-- WebSocket close frame (code 1008, "authentication failed")
```

Implementation: [`internal/ws/handler.go:handleUpgrade`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) -> `authenticateClient`.

### 2.2 Auth frame requirements

1. **First frame.** The client MUST send the auth frame as its FIRST WebSocket frame after the upgrade. Any other `type` value before auth is treated as an auth failure ([`handler.go:authenticateClient`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 136: `if msg.Type != msgTypeAuth { return error }`).
2. **No `Authorization` header.** The token MUST NOT be sent as an HTTP header on the upgrade request. Browsers cannot set arbitrary headers on the WebSocket upgrade, so the in-band frame is the only portable channel. Native clients MAY send a duplicate header for defense in depth, but the server ignores it.
3. **Deadline.** The server enforces a 5-second deadline for the auth frame (`HandlerConfig.AuthTimeout`, default `5*time.Second` from `applyHandlerDefaults`). Exceeding the deadline produces error code `auth_timeout` followed by close code 1008.
4. **Token format.** Opaque to the WebSocket layer. The configured `Authenticator` ([`internal/ws/auth.go`](../../internal/ws/auth.go)) validates it. Production uses `internal/auth.NewJWTAuthenticator` (checks signature, issuer, audience, expiry against `AuthConfig`). Dev uses `ws.NoopAuthenticator`, which accepts any non-empty token and returns the configured `VehicleIDs`.
5. **Vehicle resolution.** On a valid token the server calls `Authenticator.GetUserVehicles(ctx, userID)` and stores the resulting vehicle IDs on the `Client` struct ([`client.go:Client.vehicleIDs`](../../internal/ws/client.go)). The set is a snapshot of ownership at handshake time; per-broadcast ownership filtering uses this snapshot (§4.5). See DV-09 for the mid-connection refresh gap.
6. **Token redaction.** The token is **P1** per [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §1.2 (`AuthPayload.token`). It MUST NOT appear in any structured log, error message, metric label, or crash report. The server logs only the resolved `userID` (P0) and `vehicle_count` (P0) -- see [`hub.go:Hub.Register`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 40.

### 2.3 Auth result envelope

v1 requires the server to emit a **positive** acknowledgement frame, `auth_ok`, as the FIRST frame the client receives after a successful handshake. Its purpose is to give the SDK a deterministic transition out of `connecting` without having to wait for telemetry traffic -- which on idle vehicles may not arrive for up to one heartbeat interval (default 15 s, §7.4) and on a cold watchOS wake is the entire session.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "auth_ok",
  "payload": {
    "userId":       "clxyz1234567890userid",
    "vehicleCount": 3,
    "issuedAt":     "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `userId` | `string` (cuid) | **P1** | Echoed back from the token-resolved `userID`. Lets the SDK sanity-check ownership set on reconnect (e.g., compare against a cached user ID). |
| `vehicleCount` | `integer` | **P1** | Size of the user's vehicle set at handshake time. Gives the SDK a quick integrity check against its cached snapshot. |
| `issuedAt` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P2** | Server's `time.Now().UTC()` at the moment `Hub.Register` succeeded. Debug-only. |

SDK handling:

1. On receipt of `auth_ok`, the SDK transitions `connectionState`: `connecting -> connected` (state-machine.md C-3; C-3 is the single transition that flips `connectionState` from `connecting` to `connected` -- see [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3). This is the canonical trigger for C-3 -- the SDK MUST NOT use "first data frame" or "first heartbeat" as the trigger. DV-15 RESOLVED: `state-machine.md` §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED`, aligned by MYR-31.
2. If the `userId` field does not match a previously-cached user ID for this consumer, the SDK SHOULD surface this as a warning and clear any per-user cache that may contain values from the wrong account. This is a defense against token mix-up bugs in consumer code, not a server-side issue.
3. `vehicleCount` is informational; the authoritative ownership set is populated on the next REST snapshot fetch (§7.2).
4. **Pre-`auth_ok` liveness bound.** The SDK MUST bound its wait for `auth_ok` with a local timer of **6 seconds** (1-second grace over the server's 5-second `HandlerConfig.AuthTimeout`, to absorb one-way network latency). The timer starts the moment the `auth` frame has been handed to the socket (i.e., alongside C-1 `initializing -> connecting`). If `auth_ok` has not arrived AND no `error` frame has arrived AND the WebSocket has not closed within this window, the SDK MUST treat this as a silent handshake failure: close the socket locally with code 1001 and transition `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) with a typed reason of `auth_timeout`. This bounds the "Connecting..." UI state on degraded paths (e.g., upgrade succeeded but the server stalled post-`Hub.Register`). Without this bound the only fallback is the §7.4.1 liveness watchdog, which does not start until the first frame arrives and therefore cannot cover the pre-`auth_ok` window. The liveness watchdog (§7.4.1) is a separate, post-`auth_ok` mechanism.

The server **also** sends an explicit error frame on failure (§6.1) followed by a close frame with code 1008. Failure and success paths are mutually exclusive -- the client either sees `auth_ok` (success) or an `error` frame followed by close 1008 (failure) or the SDK pre-`auth_ok` timer expires (silent failure), never more than one.

> **Note on DV-07:** `auth_ok` is v1-required and has been pulled OUT of DV-07. The rest of DV-07 (explicit `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` / `ping` / `pong` control frames, typed `permission_denied` error) remains deferred.

### 2.4 Connection state mapping

The handshake drives the following [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 transitions:

| Wire event | `connectionState` transition | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| HTTP 101 + outbound `auth` frame | `initializing -> connecting` (C-1) | Token in flight |
| Receipt of `auth_ok` frame | `connecting -> connected` (C-3) | Canonical trigger. Reset retry counter; start SDK liveness watchdog (§7.4.1). DV-15 RESOLVED: [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED`, aligned by MYR-31. |
| SDK pre-`auth_ok` timer expires (6 s, §2.3 rule 4) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Bounds the "Connecting..." UI state on degraded paths (post-upgrade stall, dropped `auth_ok` in flight). Surface as typed `auth_timeout`; auto-retry with backoff. Independent of the post-`auth_ok` liveness watchdog (§7.4.1). |
| `Authenticator.ValidateToken` returns error | `connecting -> error` (C-5 terminal if `auth_failed`) | Surface `auth_failed` typed error; no auto-retry |
| Auth deadline exceeded (`ErrAuthTimeout`) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Surface `auth_timeout`; auto-retry with backoff. See DV-06. |
| Per-user cap breach (close code 4003) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Surface `rate_limited`; auto-retry with extended backoff. See DV-08. |
| HTTP 429 on upgrade (per-IP cap) | `connecting -> disconnected` (C-4) | Surface `rate_limited`; apply reconnect backoff. See DV-08. |
| HTTP 403 on upgrade (origin) | `connecting -> error` (C-5 terminal) | Consumer must fix origin config |

The transition IDs (C-1..C-5) are defined in [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3.

> **Divergence (DV-15): RESOLVED.** The authoritative C-3 trigger is receipt of `auth_ok` (this doc's §2.3). [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED`, aligned by MYR-31. Both docs agree on the canonical trigger. See §10 DV-15 for the audit trail.

## 3. Envelope schema

> **Anchored:** FR-1.3 (extensibility), NFR-3.1, NFR-3.11.
>
> **Schemas:**
> - [`schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json) (top-level envelope)
> - [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json) (per-`type` payloads, discriminated by `$defs`)

### 3.1 Wire shape

Every frame is a JSON object with the following top-level keys:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "vehicle_update",   // string discriminator (required)
  "payload": { ... },         // type-specific object (omitted on bare control frames)
  "seq":  42,                 // PLANNED: monotonic per-connection sequence (DV-02)
  "ts":   "2026-04-13T18:22:01Z" // PLANNED: server-authoritative envelope timestamp (DV-02)
}
```

| Field | Required today | Direction | Description |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `type` | YES | both | Discriminator. See §4 (server->client) and §5 (client->server) for the catalog. Enumerated in [`ws-envelope.schema.json#/properties/type/enum`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json). |
| `payload` | Per-type | both | Type-specific object. Omitted on `heartbeat` ([`messages.go:wsMessage.Payload`](../../internal/ws/messages.go) uses `json:"payload,omitempty"` and [`heartbeat.go`](../../internal/ws/heartbeat.go) marshals the bare envelope once at init). |
| `seq` | NO (PLANNED) | server->client | Monotonic per-connection sequence number. NOT currently emitted -- see DV-02. |
| `ts` | NO (PLANNED) | server->client | Server-authoritative ISO 8601 UTC envelope timestamp. NOT currently emitted -- see DV-02. Today, `vehicle_update.payload.timestamp`, `drive_started.payload.timestamp`, etc. carry the same information at the payload level. |

The Go struct that produces this envelope is [`internal/ws/messages.go:wsMessage`](../../internal/ws/messages.go):

```go
type wsMessage struct {
    Type    string          `json:"type"`
    Payload json.RawMessage `json:"payload,omitempty"`
}
```

**Open-object rule (FR-1.3).** All SDK parsers MUST treat the envelope and every payload as open objects: unknown keys are permitted at both levels and MUST be ignored silently. This gives us forward compatibility for new fields without a breaking wire change when FR-1.3 is exercised (extensibility as pattern). Strictness is enforced at validation time by JSON Schema / contract-tester fixtures, not at parse time in the SDK hot path.

> **Note on `additionalProperties: false` in the JSON Schemas.** Both [`ws-envelope.schema.json`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json) and [`ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json) set `additionalProperties: false` at every level. This is the **`contract-tester` invariant** -- it asserts that every fixture and every captured wire frame validated in CI contains ONLY the fields declared in this contract. It is NOT a runtime SDK requirement: the SDK hot path MUST remain permissive (ignore unknown keys, never throw on extras). Put differently, the schemas' `additionalProperties: false` means "if this frame reaches a conformance test, it MUST be exactly this shape"; the open-object rule means "if this frame reaches an SDK parser, extras MUST be tolerated." The two rules coexist because contract-tester catches drift at PR time while the SDK ships to production built against whichever schema was canonical when it was generated -- and that schema might be older than what the server emits.

### 3.2 Atomic-group rule (NFR-3.1)

A single `vehicle_update` frame's `payload.fields` map MUST contain members of **at most one** atomic group, plus any number of individually-delivered (ungrouped) fields. The atomic groups are declared in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §2 and reproduced here for wire-level clarity:

| Group | Members (wire field names) | Classification summary |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| `navigation` | `destinationName`, `destinationAddress`\*, `destinationLatitude`, `destinationLongitude`, `originLatitude`, `originLongitude`, `etaMinutes`, `tripDistanceRemaining`, `navRouteCoordinates` | Mixed -- see §4.1.2 |
| `charge` | `chargeLevel`, `chargeState`, `estimatedRange`, `timeToFull` | All **P0** |
| `gps` | `latitude`, `longitude`, `heading` | `lat`/`lng` **P1** (encrypted at rest), `heading` **P0** |
| `gear` | `gearPosition`, `status` | All **P0** |
| `drive` | `startedAt` (carried via `drive_started.payload.startedAt`) | **P0**. This is the v1 home of `tripStartTime` per DV-13. The drive group is not a `vehicle_update.fields` group; it is delivered via the `drive_started` lifecycle message (§4.2) and is never interleaved with telemetry frames. |

\* `destinationAddress` is a **spec-only** member pending MYR-24 (see [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §1.1). Until MYR-24 lands, this field is always `null` regardless of nav state and is exempt from the active-navigation predicate.

Ungrouped fields (delivered individually, no group membership): `speed`, `odometerMiles`, `interiorTemp`, `exteriorTemp`, `fsdMilesSinceReset`, `locationName`, `locationAddress`, `lastUpdated`, and the drive-only `routeCoordinates` field (§4.1.6). Their classification tiers are defined in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §1.1.

**Server enforcement** ([`internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go:handleTelemetry`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go)):

1. For each incoming telemetry event, fields are partitioned into nav vs. non-nav using [`isNavField`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go).
2. Nav fields are added to the `navAccumulator` ([`internal/ws/nav_accumulator.go`](../../internal/ws/nav_accumulator.go)), which merges them over a flush window and flushes a single `vehicle_update` per VIN per window via `flushNav` ([`internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go:flushNav`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go)).
3. Non-nav fields broadcast immediately via a separate `vehicle_update` frame from `handleTelemetry`.

The result is that a single frame never carries members from two different atomic groups. SDKs MUST validate this rule on receipt and treat a frame carrying fields from more than one atomic group as a contract violation (log it and discard the foreign-group fields; do not crash).

**Atomic groups that do NOT map to a dedicated wire accumulator:** `charge`, `gps`, and `gear`. The server delivers these groups' fields in one `vehicle_update` **iff** Tesla emits the members within a single upstream telemetry batch -- concretely, a Tesla `Payload` protobuf message with a `data[]` array of `Datum` entries covering those fields (see the [`tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme`](../../.claude/skills/tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme/) skill's `data-fields-and-protobuf.md` §"Payload wire shape" for the exact identifiers). Tesla's emission model (value-change + interval) typically batches `{latitude, longitude, heading}` and `{chargeLevel, estimatedRange}` together in the same `Payload`, which satisfies NFR-3.1 for those groups without an extra server-side debounce. Gear updates are typically single-field (`gearPosition`) with `status` derived at broadcast time -- see §4.1.5.

#### 3.2.1 Debounce window (NFR-3.2)

The canonical v1 debounce window for atomic-group accumulation on the server is **500 ms** (`defaultNavFlushInterval` in [`internal/ws/nav_accumulator.go`](../../internal/ws/nav_accumulator.go) line 12).

> **Scope note.** The 500 ms debounce applies ONLY to the **navigation** atomic group. GPS position (`latitude`, `longitude`, `heading`) is ungrouped at the server and arrives on Tesla's per-field emission cadence (see §4.1.3 and §4.1.7). `speed` is likewise ungrouped (§4.1.7, DV-10). A consumer rendering a live map therefore sees position updates at Tesla's native cadence (typically ~2 Hz driven by the 10-meter GPS delta filter, independent of the nav group), while nav-group fields (ETA, destination, polyline, trip distance) refresh at most twice per second. Two-hertz nav refresh is perceptually smooth for route-line rendering because the underlying polyline rarely changes shape at that rate; it is the destination/ETA text readout that benefits most from the debounce by avoiding half-updated reads.

**This is NOT a server-side design choice -- it is a Tesla-side floor.** The Tesla fleet telemetry emission model batches field changes in **500 ms buckets on the vehicle side**: multiple field changes that occur within the same 500 ms window are already coalesced into a single upstream `Payload` message before the server sees them. A shorter server-side accumulator window (e.g., the 200 ms literal in the current NFR-3.2 text) would fire before straggler fields from the SAME logical update have arrived, causing exactly the half-updated UI race that the accumulator exists to prevent. See the [`tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme`](../../.claude/skills/tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme/) skill's `architecture-and-setup.md` §"Emission model" for the authoritative reference on the 500 ms bucket behavior.

> **Note on `interval_seconds` minimums.** The MyRoboTaxi server configures its nav-field requests at `interval_seconds: 1` in [`internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go`](../../internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go) lines 112-118. Whether Tesla itself imposes a hard **1-second minimum** on the `interval_seconds` parameter is currently undocumented in the Tesla sources the `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill has verified -- the 1-second value is our highest-cadence request, not a published Tesla floor. The 500 ms vehicle-side batch behavior above is the authoritative argument for the 500 ms accumulator window; the `interval_seconds` parameter sets the REQUESTED cadence, while the 500 ms bucket sets the DELIVERED-as-one-message cadence. Do not conflate the two.

The NFR-3.2 literal of 200 ms was authored before this Tesla constraint was understood and is incorrect. Amending NFR-3.2 in `requirements.md` from 200 ms to 500 ms is a prerequisite follow-up tracked as **DV-01** in §10 (requirement-drift divergence, not implementation drift -- the server is correct and the requirement is wrong).

For the purpose of this wire contract: **SDKs MUST NOT assume any specific debounce timing**. Two updates to the same atomic group arriving within the debounce window MAY be coalesced into a single frame. The only guarantee is the atomic-group rule above.

### 3.3 Sequence and timestamp (NFR-3.11)

The Linear AC for MYR-11 calls for a "type discriminator, sequence, timestamp" envelope. Today only the `type` discriminator and per-payload `timestamp` field exist. The envelope-level `seq` and `ts` fields are **PLANNED** (DV-02). This doc and the AsyncAPI spec describe the **target shape** so SDK consumers can plan for it. Until the server begins emitting these fields, SDKs MUST tolerate their absence.

Rationale for not shipping `seq`/`ts` in v1.0:

1. The current server has no per-connection sequence counter ([`client.go:Client`](../../internal/ws/client.go) struct has `userID`, `vehicleIDs`, `send`, `remoteAddr`, `hub`, `logger` -- no `nextSeq`).
2. Reconnect-resume is currently implemented entirely client-side via REST snapshot fetch (see [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §5), which establishes a consistent baseline without needing wire-level sequence numbers. The trade-off: clients cannot detect dropped frames within a single connection.
3. Adding `seq` is a coordinated server + SDK + fixture change. It is a v1.x extension, not a v1.0 ship blocker.

> **SDK MUST:** treat `seq` and `ts` as optional. When they appear, prefer envelope `ts` over payload `timestamp` for ordering.
>
> **SDK SHOULD:** maintain a per-connection "highest seq seen" counter as soon as the server begins emitting `seq`, and pass it as `subscribe.sinceSeq` (§5.2) on reconnect.

### 3.4 Frame size

The server enforces a 4 KiB read limit on inbound (client->server) frames via `Conn.SetReadLimit(readLimit)` ([`internal/ws/client.go`](../../internal/ws/client.go) line 19). The expected client traffic is exclusively `auth` plus the PLANNED control frames -- 4 KiB is generous.

Outbound (server->client) frames have no hard cap. Long `navRouteCoordinates` payloads from city-scale Tesla routes are the largest realistic frames (~5-15 KB serialized). SDKs MUST tolerate server->client frames up to 1 MB without truncation; beyond that is a server-side bug.

This section is the wire-level catalog. Field-level types, units, nullability, and per-field data classification live in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) and the canonical JSON Schema ([`schemas/vehicle-state.schema.json`](schemas/vehicle-state.schema.json)) -- they are not duplicated here.

### 4.1 `vehicle_update`

> **Anchored:** FR-1.1, FR-1.2, FR-1.3, FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, NFR-3.1, NFR-3.2, NFR-3.5, NFR-3.9.
>
> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/VehicleUpdatePayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)

The primary telemetry payload. One frame carries field updates for one vehicle, scoped to at most one atomic group per §3.2.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "vehicle_update",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "fields": {
      // members of AT MOST one atomic group + any number of ungrouped fields
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:22:01Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `payload.vehicleId` | `string` (cuid) | **P0** | Opaque DB ID, never VIN (FR-4.2, `data-classification.md` §1.3 `Vehicle.id`). |
| `payload.fields` | `object` | mixed per-field | See [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §1.1. Atomic-group membership enforced per §3.2. |
| `payload.timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | Server's `time.Now().UTC()` at broadcast (for nav flushes) or telemetry event `CreatedAt` (for non-nav broadcasts). See [`nav_broadcast.go:handleTelemetry`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go) line 67 and [`flushNav`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go) line 98. |

#### 4.1.1 Wire field names vs. internal names

The wire field names in `payload.fields` are the **frontend / SDK** names, not the Tesla protobuf names. The server translates internal telemetry names to client names in [`internal/ws/field_mapping.go:internalToClientField`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go):

| Tesla / internal name | Wire field name |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `soc` | `chargeLevel` |
| `gear` | `gearPosition` |
| `odometer` | `odometerMiles` |
| `insideTemp` | `interiorTemp` |
| `outsideTemp` | `exteriorTemp` |
| `minutesToArrival` | `etaMinutes` |
| `milesToArrival` | `tripDistanceRemaining` |
| `fsdMilesSinceReset` | `fsdMilesSinceReset` |
| `location` (compound) | split into `latitude` + `longitude` |
| `destinationLocation` | split into `destinationLatitude` + `destinationLongitude` |
| `originLocation` | split into `originLatitude` + `originLongitude` |
| `routeLine` (Tesla encoded polyline) | `navRouteCoordinates` (decoded `[lng, lat]` array) |

Integer rounding is applied server-side to the fields listed in `integerFields` (`speed`, `heading`, `chargeLevel`, `estimatedRange`, `etaMinutes`, `interiorTemp`, `exteriorTemp`, `odometerMiles`, `fanSpeed`, seat heater and climate settings). See [`field_mapping.go:roundIfInteger`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go).

SDKs MUST accept the integer-rounded values as-is and MUST NOT round-trip through floats.

#### 4.1.2 Navigation group

> **Anchored:** FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, NFR-3.1, NFR-3.2, NFR-3.9.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.navigation` (per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §2)
> **Fixtures:** `vehicle_update.nav_active.json`, `vehicle_update.nav_clear.json` (planned, [`fixtures/README.md`](fixtures/README.md))

Members (per [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §2.1): `destinationName`, `destinationAddress`, `destinationLatitude`, `destinationLongitude`, `originLatitude`, `originLongitude`, `etaMinutes`, `tripDistanceRemaining`, `navRouteCoordinates`.

| Field | Classification | Encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) |
|-------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `destinationName` | **P1** | No (disk encryption only) |
| `destinationAddress` | **P1** (spec-only, MYR-24) | No |
| `destinationLatitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `destinationLongitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `originLatitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `originLongitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `etaMinutes` | **P0** | No |
| `tripDistanceRemaining` | **P0** | No |
| `navRouteCoordinates` | **P1** | Yes |

Encryption flags are from [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §3.1.

**Server flow:** All nav-related Tesla fields (`destinationName`, `destinationLocation`, `originLocation`, `routeLine`, `minutesToArrival`, `milesToArrival`) are routed through [`navAccumulator.Add`](../../internal/ws/nav_accumulator.go) via [`handleTelemetry`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go) line 28. The accumulator starts a timer on the first nav field for a VIN and merges subsequent nav fields within the flush window. On timer expiry the batch is delivered via [`flushNav`](../../internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go), which resolves VIN -> vehicleId, maps fields, appends a `lastUpdated`, and broadcasts a single `vehicle_update`. The accumulator is also drained synchronously on `drive_ended` ([`broadcaster.go`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 166) and on `connectivity.online=false` ([`broadcaster.go`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 227), so pending nav fields never outlive their relevance.

**Nav clear (FR-2.3):** When Tesla marks a nav field as `Invalid`, the server translates each invalid field to a JSON `null` in `payload.fields`. The mapping is defined by [`navClearFields`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go) line 78:

| Internal field invalidated | Client fields set to `null` |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| `destinationName` | `destinationName` |
| `milesToArrival` | `tripDistanceRemaining` |
| `minutesToArrival` | `etaMinutes` |
| `routeLine` | `navRouteCoordinates` |
| `originLocation` | `originLatitude`, `originLongitude` |
| `destinationLocation` | `destinationLatitude`, `destinationLongitude` |

**SDK amplification rule (NFR-3.9 + Rule CG-SM-3):** When ANY nav group field arrives as `null`, the SDK MUST null ALL navigation group fields atomically in its in-memory state, regardless of whether the server explicitly sent every member. The server is permitted (and does today) to send a partial clear -- the SDK is responsible for amplifying it to the full group. This is non-negotiable: it's the only way to satisfy the "no half-cleared nav" invariant (NFR-3.4).

#### 4.1.3 GPS group

> **Anchored:** FR-1.1, NFR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.gps`
> **Fixture:** `vehicle_update.gps.json` (planned)

Members: `latitude`, `longitude`, `heading`.

| Field | Classification | Encrypted at rest |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| `latitude` | **P1** | Yes (AES-256-GCM) |
| `longitude` | **P1** | Yes |
| `heading` | **P0** | No |

**Server flow:** When Tesla emits a `Location` compound value, the server splits it into separate `latitude` and `longitude` keys via [`splitLocationField`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go). `heading` is delivered alongside whenever Tesla emits `GpsHeading`. There is no dedicated server-side accumulator for GPS -- `handleTelemetry` broadcasts non-nav fields immediately. Tesla's upstream emission typically batches `location` + `heading` together, which delivers them in the same outbound `vehicle_update` in practice.

**0,0 sentinel:** Per [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §2.3, the DB default for unset coordinates is `(0, 0)`. SDKs MUST treat `latitude == 0 && longitude == 0` as "no fix" rather than a valid point in the Gulf of Guinea.

#### 4.1.4 Charge group

> **Anchored:** FR-1.2, NFR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.charge`
> **Fixture:** `vehicle_update.charge.json` (planned)

Members (v1): `chargeLevel`, `chargeState`, `estimatedRange`, `timeToFull`. All **P0** (log-safe, no encryption at rest).

| Field | Type | Unit | Tesla source | Notes |
|-------|------|------|--------------|-------|
| `chargeLevel` | `integer` (0-100) | percent | proto field `Soc` / `BatteryLevel` | Integer-rounded server-side. |
| `chargeState` | `string` (enum) | -- | proto field **2** (`ChargeState`) | Enum values: `Unknown`, `Disconnected`, `NoPower`, `Starting`, `Charging`, `Complete`, `Stopped`. Native Tesla emission -- see [`tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme`](../../.claude/skills/tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme/) skill. `DetailedChargeState` (proto field 179) is the finer-grained companion already configured at 30 s interval in [`internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go`](../../internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go) line 129, and MAY be layered in via the ungrouped-field path in the future. |
| `estimatedRange` | `integer` | miles | proto `EstBatteryRange` | Integer-rounded server-side. |
| `timeToFull` | `number` | **hours** (decimal) | proto field **43** (`TimeToFullCharge`, `double`) | **Hours** (decimal, fractional values supported -- e.g. `1.5` for 90 minutes) to full charge at the current rate. `0` (or `null` when disconnected) means no active charging session. Unit is sourced from the `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill's `data-fields-and-protobuf.md` §"TimeToFullCharge" ("Estimated hours to reach charge limit") and the legacy Tesla REST API `time_to_full_charge` field, both of which consistently use hours. Tesla proto type is `double`, so the wire value is a JSON number (NOT rounded to integer). **Empirical verification of the unit against a charging vehicle is tracked as DV-17** -- if the observed value disagrees with the skill reference, this row MUST be corrected before any SDK build that generates types against it ships. |

**Server flow:** Mapped from Tesla's native fields above. Today the server requests `chargeLevel` (via `FleetFieldSOC` / `FleetFieldBatteryLevel`) and `estimatedRange` (via `FleetFieldEstBatteryRange`) on a 30-second cadence. Both configured in [`internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go`](../../internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go) within the Battery/Charging block (lines 121-129 span nine fields total; the two v1 members are two of those nine). `chargeState` and `timeToFull` are **NOT yet in `DefaultFieldConfig`** (tracked as DV-03 + DV-04 + DV-18). Once the follow-up implementation lands and all four fields are configured, any field change that occurs within the same Tesla 500 ms vehicle-side bucket will be delivered in a single upstream `Payload` protobuf message and the broadcaster will emit the four-field batch in one `vehicle_update`. Until then, the charge group arrives as a two-field batch (`chargeLevel`, `estimatedRange`) and the `null` placeholder rule below applies.

**Implementation follow-up (MYR-TBD).** `chargeState` and `timeToFull` are part of the v1 wire contract but are not yet wired in the server. The follow-up implementation issue must:

1. Add `FleetFieldChargeState` to [`internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go`](../../internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go) (proto field 2) alongside the existing `DetailedChargeState` (proto 179) entry.
2. Add `FleetFieldTimeToFullCharge` to the same file (proto field 43, type `double`).
3. Extend the telemetry decoder mapping so both fields reach the Go `Vehicle` struct.
4. Add the corresponding DB columns (classification **P0**, non-encrypted) via migration.
5. Wire the broadcaster field names through [`internal/ws/field_mapping.go`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go) so they appear in `vehicle_update.fields` under their canonical wire names.

This contract is the authoritative source for the target shape; tracked as **DV-03** + **DV-04** in §10 (both RESOLVED; implementation issue follows).

> **SDK MUST** tolerate `null` for `chargeState` and `timeToFull` on any frame delivered BEFORE the implementation follow-up ships. Once the server begins emitting them, the charge atomic group MUST arrive as a four-field batch.

> **Generated SDK types.** Until DV-03 / DV-04 are fully wired, generated SDK types for `chargeState` and `timeToFull` MUST be nullable (`string | null` in TypeScript, `String?` / `Optional<String>` in Swift, `Double?` for `timeToFull` in Swift). Do not emit non-null types with a runtime contract assertion -- the nullable window is the contract until the implementation lands, not a bug to assert away. Once the server begins emitting both fields, the nullability markers can be tightened to non-null in a follow-up generator run.
>
> **Consumer UI.** SDK consumers rendering charge state SHOULD surface `null` as a neutral placeholder (`--`, `—`, or hide the field entirely), NOT as a loading spinner. With `dataState.charge = ready` and `chargeState: null`, the steady-state meaning is "no data yet from Tesla for this field," NOT "loading in progress." A spinner implies work is in flight, which is misleading during the pre-wiring window. A time-to-full display might read `— minutes remaining` until the server starts emitting `timeToFull`; a charge-state badge might hide until `chargeState` becomes non-null.

#### 4.1.5 Gear group

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.gear`
> **Fixture:** `vehicle_update.gear.json` (planned)

Members: `gearPosition`, `status`. Both **P0**.

`status` is **derived server-side** at broadcast time by [`deriveVehicleStatus`](../../internal/ws/field_mapping.go) from `gearPosition` (and `speed` as a fallback when gear is missing). The broadcaster injects `status` into the `vehicle_update` iff `gearPosition` is present in the same frame:

```go
// internal/ws/nav_broadcast.go:60-62
if _, hasGear := fields["gearPosition"]; hasGear {
    fields["status"] = deriveVehicleStatus(fields)
}
```

Per [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §3.4 predicate 1, the SDK MUST validate the gear-to-status derivation on receipt: `D` or `R` => `driving`, `P` or `N` => `parked` (unless overridden by `charging`, `offline`, or `in_service` from server-side logic). A mismatch is logged as a consistency error but the frame is still applied.

#### 4.1.6 Drive route updates (`drive_updated` is virtual)

> **Anchored:** FR-3.1.
> **dataState target:** `dataState.gps`
> **Drive lifecycle target:** `driving -> driving` (DR-2)
> **Fixture:** `vehicle_update.route.json` (planned)

Per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.1, `drive_updated` is **NOT a distinct wire message type**. During an active drive, the broadcaster's [`handleDriveUpdated`](../../internal/ws/route_broadcast.go) appends each GPS point to a per-VIN [`routeAccumulator`](../../internal/ws/route_accumulator.go). When the accumulator hits its batch threshold (`defaultRouteBatchSize = 5`) or its flush interval (`defaultRouteFlushInterval = 3*time.Second`), the broadcaster sends a `vehicle_update` whose `payload.fields` contains a **single key** `routeCoordinates`:

```jsonc
{
  "type": "vehicle_update",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "fields": {
      "routeCoordinates": [[-122.4194, 37.7749], [-122.4193, 37.7750], ...]
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:23:05Z"
  }
}
```

`routeCoordinates` is `[lng, lat]` order (GeoJSON / Mapbox), distinct from the navigation group's `navRouteCoordinates`. Each element is a per-point pair derived from [`routeCoordinate`](../../internal/ws/route_accumulator.go). The accumulator's buffer is **not cleared on flush** -- each batch contains the **complete driven path** so the SDK can render the full polyline by replacing rather than appending. The buffer is cleared only on `drive_ended` ([`broadcaster.go:handleDriveEnded`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 162).

| Sub-field | Classification | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| `routeCoordinates[i][0]` (lng) | **P1** | Same tier as `Vehicle.longitude` |
| `routeCoordinates[i][1]` (lat) | **P1** | Same tier as `Vehicle.latitude` |

**SDK requirement:** On receipt of a `vehicle_update` containing `routeCoordinates` during an active drive, the SDK MUST emit `drive_updated` as a logical event to consumers AND merge the array into its in-memory drive state. Per Rule CG-SM-6 in [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §7, the SDK MUST NOT synthesize `drive_updated` from any other source (no gear-change heuristics, no speed thresholds). Drive detection is server-only.

#### 4.1.7 Ungrouped fields

`speed` is delivered ungrouped even though `requirements.md` NFR-3.1 text puts it in the GPS group. This is a resolved decision in [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §7.1: speed updates at 2 s cadence while GPS uses a 10 m delta filter, so coupling them would either delay speed updates or flood GPS updates. DV-10 records this as an accepted divergence from the NFR literal.

Other ungrouped fields: `odometerMiles`, `interiorTemp`, `exteriorTemp`, `fsdMilesSinceReset`, `locationName`, `locationAddress`, `lastUpdated`. None of these transition a `dataState` group on receipt (per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.3 footnote). Their freshness is implied by `connectionState`.

`lastUpdated` is set by the server on every outbound `vehicle_update` (`nav_broadcast.go` lines 59 and 99) to the event's `CreatedAt` for non-nav broadcasts or `time.Now().UTC()` for nav flushes. SDKs SHOULD surface this to consumers as the "most recent telemetry timestamp" for the vehicle.

### 4.2 `drive_started`

> **Anchored:** FR-3.1, NFR-3.1 (carries the `drive` atomic group's `startedAt` field per DV-13).
> **Drive lifecycle target:** `idle -> driving` (DR-1) or `ended -> driving` (DR-6)
> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/DriveStartedPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixture:** `drive_started.json` (planned)

```jsonc
{
  "type": "drive_started",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "driveId": "clmno9876543210zyxw",
    "startLocation": {
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194
    },
    "startedAt": "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `vehicleId` | `string` (cuid) | **P0** | |
| `driveId` | `string` (cuid) | **P0** | Matches the eventual persisted `Drive.id` at drive completion. |
| `startLocation.latitude` | `number` | **P1** | Encrypted at rest inside `Drive.routePoints` ([`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §1.5); plaintext on the wire under WSS (NFR-3.22). |
| `startLocation.longitude` | `number` | **P1** | Same as above. |
| `startedAt` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | **This is the v1 home of `tripStartTime`** per DV-13. Value is `StartedAt` from the drive detector's `DriveStartedEvent`. It is repeated alongside `timestamp` (below) rather than replacing it to make the SDK binding obvious: `DriveStarted.startedAt` is the semantic drive-lifecycle timestamp; `timestamp` is the envelope-equivalent event time. SDKs MUST treat `startedAt` as the authoritative `tripStartTime` for consumers. |
| `timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | Envelope-level event time. For `drive_started`, this is always equal to `startedAt`; the two are separate fields purely to keep every `server->client` message shape uniform on `timestamp`. |

**Note on DV-13 (`tripStartTime`).** NFR-3.1 originally listed `tripStartTime` as a member of the *navigation* atomic group. There is no Tesla field for `tripStartTime` -- it is derived from the drive detector's `started_at` timestamp in [`internal/drives/`](../../internal/drives/). Semantically it belongs with the drive, not with nav: forcing it into the nav group would require a cross-subsystem join that Tesla's 500 ms bucket floor (§3.2.1) cannot deliver atomically, and a vehicle can have no nav but still have an active drive. v1 therefore relocates `tripStartTime` from the `navigation` group to the `drive` group, where it is carried as `drive_started.payload.startedAt` on the wire. Amending the NFR-3.1 literal in `requirements.md` is a follow-up tracked as **DV-13** in §10.

Source: [`internal/drives/transitions.go`](../../internal/drives/transitions.go) publishes `events.DriveStartedEvent`; [`internal/ws/broadcaster.go:handleDriveStarted`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 99 resolves the VIN to a vehicleId and marshals the frame.

### 4.3 `drive_ended`

> **Anchored:** FR-3.1, FR-3.4 (with explicit scope note).
> **Drive lifecycle target:** `driving -> ended` (DR-3)
> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/DriveEndedPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixture:** `drive_ended.json` (planned)

**The `drive_ended` wire payload is a SUMMARY.** It carries only the handful of fields an SDK consumer needs to render an immediate "drive finished" toast / card / complication. The full FR-3.4 drive record is retrieved via REST `GET /drives/{id}`, which is the authoritative source for every field FR-3.4 lists. See the scope note below for the full contract.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "drive_ended",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "driveId": "clmno9876543210zyxw",
    "distance": 12.4,
    "durationSeconds": 1458,
    "avgSpeed": 30.5,
    "maxSpeed": 65.2,
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:46:18Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `vehicleId` | `string` | **P0** | |
| `driveId` | `string` | **P0** | Opaque drive cuid -- the input to `fetchDrive(driveId)` (see "SDK consumption" below). |
| `distance` | `number` (miles) | **P0** | Haversine sum from `DriveStats.Distance`. |
| `durationSeconds` | `number` (seconds) | **P0** | Drive duration in seconds, as a JSON number (`double`). Server-side value is `DriveStats.Duration.Seconds()`. **The earlier Go `time.Duration.String()` format (e.g. `"24m18s"`) is not part of the v1 wire contract** -- it was dropped before v1 ship because there are no pre-v1 consumers and the Go-native string would force every SDK to write a parser for a format it otherwise never sees. See DV-12 (RESOLVED). TypeScript consumers construct a `Date` delta or `Temporal.Duration` from this field; Swift consumers map directly to `Duration(secondsComponent:attosecondsComponent:)` or `TimeInterval`. |
| `avgSpeed` | `number` (mph) | **P0** | `DriveStats.AvgSpeed` |
| `maxSpeed` | `number` (mph) | **P0** | `DriveStats.MaxSpeed` |
| `timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** | `EndedAt` from the drive detector. |

Source: [`internal/ws/broadcaster.go:handleDriveEnded`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 140. Server emits `DriveStats.Duration.Seconds()` as `durationSeconds` (DV-12 RESOLVED by MYR-32).

**SDK consumption.** The v1 SDK surface is:

- **TypeScript**: `client.onDriveEnded(cb)` for the live summary, `await client.fetchDrive(id)` for the full FR-3.4 record, plus a `useDrive(id)` React hook that wraps the fetch + local cache.
- **Swift**: `client.onDriveEnded { summary in ... }` for the live summary, `try await client.fetchDrive(summary.driveId)` for the full FR-3.4 record.

Neither SDK auto-fetches the full record on `drive_ended`: doing so would burn cellular bandwidth on every idle consumer (especially bad for watchOS, per NFR-3.36). Consumers that need the full record call `fetchDrive` explicitly when the UI renders a detail view.

> **Scope note (FR-3.4 vs wire payload).** `requirements.md` FR-3.4 lists the full drive record as `{distance, duration, avgSpeed, maxSpeed, energyUsed, fsdMiles, interventions, startChargeLevel, endChargeLevel, startLocation+address, endLocation+address}`. The **wire** `drive_ended` payload contains only the summary fields above. The remaining FR-3.4 fields are available via REST `GET /drives/{id}` (see [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md)) and are persisted in the `Drive` table ([`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §1.4). The canonical references for this split are [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §3.3 (drive lifecycle -> `ended`) and [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.1 (`drive_ended` event), plus [`data-lifecycle.md`](data-lifecycle.md) for the persistence side. This is not a divergence -- the split between "real-time fast summary" and "post-hoc full record" is intentional for NFR-3.1 latency reasons and was confirmed by both SDK agents (Option A: summary on wire + explicit `fetchDrive(driveId)` helper). Tracked as **DV-11** (RESOLVED) in §10 for audit-trail continuity.

> **Micro-drive filter:** Drives that fail the micro-drive filter (default 2 minutes / 0.1 miles, [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §3.5) NEVER produce a `drive_ended` frame. The SDK relies on `WS_DISCONNECTED` (DR-4) or an extended absence of route updates as the only signal that an in-progress drive was suppressed. This is documented behavior, not a divergence.

### 4.4 `connectivity`

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/ConnectivityPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixtures:** `connectivity.online.json`, `connectivity.offline.json` (planned)

```jsonc
{
  "type": "connectivity",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "online": true,
    "timestamp": "2026-04-13T18:22:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `vehicleId` | `string` | **P0** |
| `online` | `boolean` | **P0** |
| `timestamp` | `string` (ISO 8601 UTC) | **P0** |

**Important distinction:** `connectivity.online` reports the **vehicle<->server** (Tesla mTLS) connection status, NOT the **SDK client<->server** (WebSocket) status. The latter is implicit in the WebSocket connection itself -- an absent connection IS the disconnected state.

Per [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §4.2, `connectivity` does NOT directly transition `connectionState` -- the SDK already knows its WebSocket is open, since it just received a frame on it. The signal is informational: the UI may show "Vehicle offline" while continuing to display cached data. When the server emits `connectivity.online: false`, the broadcaster also clears any pending nav accumulator state for that VIN to prevent stale nav data on reconnect ([`broadcaster.go:handleConnectivity`](../../internal/ws/broadcaster.go) line 227).

### 4.5 Per-vehicle ownership filtering

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.21.

`Hub.Broadcast(vehicleID, msg)` ([`internal/ws/hub.go`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 70) iterates every connected client and calls `client.hasVehicle(vehicleID)`. Only clients whose `vehicleIDs` slice (populated at handshake time from `Authenticator.GetUserVehicles`) contains the target vehicle ID receive the frame. Clients with an empty vehicle list (the `NoopAuthenticator` dev mode) receive **all** broadcasts -- this is explicit in [`client.go:hasVehicle`](../../internal/ws/client.go) line 120 and is intentional for local development.

The SDK can rely on the following contract: **an authenticated production client will NEVER receive a `vehicle_update`, `drive_started`, `drive_ended`, or `connectivity` frame for a vehicle it does not own at handshake time.**

> **Divergence (DV-09):** Ownership changes after the handshake (e.g., invite revoked) take effect only on the next reconnection -- the in-memory `vehicleIDs` snapshot is not refreshed mid-connection. Tracked in §10.

`heartbeat` frames are broadcast to ALL clients regardless of vehicle ownership via [`Hub.BroadcastAll`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 90 -- they carry no vehicle-scoped data.

---

## 5. Client -> server message catalog

> **Anchored:** FR-6.1, FR-6.2, NFR-3.21.

### Catalog summary

| `type` | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------|
| `auth` | **Implemented** | [`handler.go:authenticateClient`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) | The ONLY client->server frame the server reads today. |
| `subscribe` | **PLANNED** (DV-07) | n/a | Reserved in schema; ignored on the wire. |
| `unsubscribe` | **PLANNED** (DV-07) | n/a | Reserved in schema; ignored on the wire. |
| `ping` | **PLANNED** (DV-07) | n/a | Reserved in schema; ignored on the wire. RFC 6455 PING/PONG handled transparently by `coder/websocket` today. |

**Critical fact:** after auth completes, the server's `readPump` ([`client.go:readPump`](../../internal/ws/client.go) lines 74-90) **explicitly ignores** all incoming client frames. The read loop exists only to detect socket disconnect:

```go
// internal/ws/client.go:87-89
// Post-auth messages are ignored; the read is only to detect
// disconnects and keep the connection alive.
```

This means SDK consumers MUST NOT today rely on `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`ping` wire frames -- the server will silently drop them without even a parse error. The TypeScript and Swift SDKs MUST gate any such send sites behind a feature flag tied to a future server version once DV-07 ships.

### 5.1 `auth`

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/AuthPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixture:** `auth.json` (planned)

```jsonc
{
  "type": "auth",
  "payload": {
    "token": "<opaque session token>"
  }
}
```

| Field | Classification | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| `token` | **P1** | Never log. See [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §2.2 and the `AuthPayload.token` row in the JSON Schema (`x-classification: P1`). |

See §2.2 for full handshake semantics.

### 5.2 `subscribe` (PLANNED)

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/SubscribePayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)

NOT yet implemented (DV-07). Today, the server implicitly subscribes the client to ALL vehicles returned by `Authenticator.GetUserVehicles(userID)` during the auth handshake. A future revision will let the client narrow the subscription per-vehicle and pass a `sinceSeq` for snapshot resume (NFR-3.11).

```jsonc
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef",
    "sinceSeq": 4271
  }
}
```

When implemented, the server response will be either:

- A normal `vehicle_update` stream starting at `sinceSeq + 1`, OR
- An `error` frame with `code: snapshot_required` indicating the client must perform a full REST snapshot fetch (NFR-3.11) and reconnect.

Both `sinceSeq` acceptance and `snapshot_required` emission depend on DV-02 (envelope `seq`) landing first.

### 5.3 `unsubscribe` (PLANNED)

NOT yet implemented. Will release a per-vehicle subscription without closing the entire WebSocket.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "unsubscribe",
  "payload": {
    "vehicleId": "clxyz1234567890abcdef"
  }
}
```

### 5.4 `ping` (PLANNED)

NOT yet implemented. Today, application-level ping is unnecessary because:

1. The [`coder/websocket`](https://github.com/coder/websocket) library handles RFC 6455 PING/PONG control frames transparently in both directions.
2. The server emits `heartbeat` frames on a 15-second cadence (§7.4), giving the SDK a frequent positive liveness signal.

A future application-level `ping` is reserved for platforms where the WebSocket library does not expose RFC 6455 PING/PONG (some React Native runtimes, watchOS background sessions per NFR-3.36).

```jsonc
{
  "type": "ping",
  "payload": {
    "nonce": "<opaque round-trip ID>"
  }
}
```

The server response will be a `pong` echoing the nonce. `pong` is also reserved in [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/PongPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json) and in the AsyncAPI spec, but is not yet emitted.

---

## 6. Errors and close codes

> **Anchored:** FR-7.1, FR-7.3, NFR-3.10, NFR-3.21.

### 6.1 Error frame

> **Schema:** [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json#/$defs/ErrorPayload`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json)
> **Fixtures:** `error.auth_failed.json`, `error.auth_timeout.json` (planned)

```jsonc
{
  "type": "error",
  "payload": {
    "code": "auth_failed",
    "message": "invalid token"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Classification |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `code` | `string` (enum) | **P0** |
| `message` | `string` | **P0** (MUST NOT contain P1 values; see §6.3 + [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §2.2) |

Per FR-7.1, consumer SDKs MUST map `code` to typed error values and branch on the typed value, NEVER on the human-readable `message`. The `message` is intended for logs and developer tooling only.

#### 6.1.1 Error code catalog

| Code | Today | Direction | Reconnect policy | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `auth_failed` | **Implemented** ([`messages.go:errCodeAuthFailed`](../../internal/ws/messages.go)) | server->client (handshake) | Surface to UI; **do not auto-retry**. Consumer must re-auth. | Token signature/issuer/audience/expiry check failed, or `GetUserVehicles` failed. |
| `auth_timeout` | **Implemented** ([`messages.go:errCodeAuthTimeout`](../../internal/ws/messages.go)) | server->client (handshake) | **Auto-retry with backoff** (NFR-3.10) | Client did not send the auth frame within `HandlerConfig.AuthTimeout` (default 5 s). Treated as transient. |
| `permission_denied` | **PLANNED** (DV-07) | server->client | Surface to UI; do not auto-retry the same vehicle | Authenticated user attempted to subscribe to a vehicle they do not own. Today this is enforced silently by `Hub.Broadcast` filtering and produces no error frame. |
| `vehicle_not_owned` | **PLANNED** (DV-07) | server->client | Surface to UI | Specific case of `permission_denied` for an explicit `subscribe` (§5.2). |
| `rate_limited` | **PLANNED** (DV-08) | server->client (per-user breach, paired with close 4003) OR HTTP 429 on upgrade (per-IP breach) | Auto-retry with **extended** backoff -- see pseudocode below. | Caller-facing signal: a concurrent-connection cap was breached. Per-user breach (post-auth, close 4003) and per-IP breach (pre-auth, HTTP 429) are both surfaced to the caller as the same typed error `rate_limited`; the SDK may inspect the underlying transport status for diagnostic logging but MUST NOT branch consumer-visible behavior on it. See §1.3 for the cap defaults, enforcement points, and the `rate_limited.device_cap` sub-code for the per-user breach. |
| `internal_error` | **PLANNED** | server->client | Auto-retry with backoff | Catch-all for unexpected server failures during a live session. |
| `snapshot_required` | **PLANNED** (DV-02) | server->client | Run the reconnect sequence (§7.2): re-fetch REST snapshot and restart live stream. | Server cannot satisfy the client's `subscribe.sinceSeq` request because the gap is too large. Requires DV-02 (`seq`) to ship. |

The PLANNED codes are reserved in the AsyncAPI spec and JSON Schemas today so SDKs can match against them once the server emits them. The schema enum is the canonical list -- when a new code is added, the enum, this table, and the contract-guard rules MUST all be updated in the same PR.

##### `rate_limited` reconnect pseudocode

```
// On receipt of error.code == "rate_limited" (or HTTP 429 on upgrade),
// the SDK MUST use this backoff curve instead of the §7.1 default.
onRateLimited(source, subCode):
    // source ∈ {per_user_close_4003, per_ip_http_429}
    // subCode ∈ {device_cap, null}
    if subCode == "device_cap":
        // Terminal-ish: device 6+ on a 5-cap. Do NOT retry automatically;
        // surface a typed UI signal so the user can sign out another device.
        emit UI event "device_cap_reached" { userVisible: true }
        return DO_NOT_RETRY

    // All other rate_limited variants: extended exponential backoff.
    attempt       += 1
    baseDelay     := §7.1 curve[attempt]           // e.g. 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ...
    minDelay      := max(baseDelay, 2 * §7.1 curve[1])  // skip the 1s slot
    elapsedSince  := now - firstRateLimitedAt

    if source == per_user_close_4003 AND elapsedSince < 60s:
        // First minute after a per-user cap breach: pin to the §7.1 max delay
        // to avoid pounding the cap while another device releases its slot.
        delay := §7.1 maxDelay
    else:
        delay := minDelay + jitter(±20%)

    scheduleReconnect(delay)
```

> **`rate_limited.device_cap` sub-code.** When the server emits `error.code == "rate_limited"` specifically because the caller breached the **per-user** cap (§1.3, default 5 concurrent connections per user), the error frame MUST carry an additional `subCode: "device_cap"` field. SDKs MUST surface this as a typed UI signal (e.g., `DeviceCapReachedError`) distinct from generic rate-limiting, so consumer apps can render an actionable message ("Too many devices signed in -- sign out of another device to continue") instead of a misleading "Network busy, retrying..." toast. Per-IP breaches (HTTP 429 on upgrade) do NOT carry a sub-code because the SDK cannot distinguish a NAT-mate flood from user intent. This is the single deviation from the "SDK MUST NOT branch consumer-visible behavior on cap source" rule: a `device_cap` sub-code is an explicit opt-in for per-user clarity.

### 6.2 WebSocket close codes

> **Anchored:** RFC 6455 §7.4. Application-specific codes use the 4000-4999 range.

The Go server uses [`coder/websocket`](https://github.com/coder/websocket) status constants. Today the server explicitly closes the socket with the following codes:

| Code | Name | Today | Source (Go) | When | SDK reconnect policy |
|------|------|-------|-------------|------|----------------------|
| `1001` | Going Away | **Implemented** | [`client.go:writePump`](../../internal/ws/client.go) line 56 (`websocket.StatusGoingAway`) | Hub closed the client's send channel (server shutdown) | Auto-reconnect with backoff (C-6 + D-4) |
| `1008` | Policy Violation | **Implemented** | [`handler.go:handleUpgrade`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 93 (`websocket.StatusPolicyViolation`) | Authentication failed (sent immediately after the `error` frame) | Branches on the preceding `error.code` -- see below |
| `1000` | Normal Closure | Tolerated | n/a | Client closed the socket cleanly | n/a (client-initiated) |

> **Divergence (DV-06):** Close code 1008 is emitted for BOTH `auth_failed` (terminal, do-not-retry) and `auth_timeout` (transient, auto-retry). The SDK has to disambiguate by reading the preceding `error.code`, which is fragile if the error frame fails to arrive. Target: map `auth_timeout` to its own close code (proposal: 4001 "Auth Token Expired" or a dedicated 40xx value once DV-06 is resolved).

In addition, RFC 6455 reserves codes 4000-4999 for **application-specific** usage. The following application-specific codes are **PLANNED** (reserved by this contract for future server emission). SDKs SHOULD recognize them but MUST NOT panic on receipt of any 4xxx code they don't know.

| Code | Name | When | SDK reconnect policy |
|------|------|------|----------------------|
| `4001` | Auth Token Expired | Server detected mid-session token expiry (e.g., JWT `exp` passed) OR client needs to refresh before reconnect (DV-06 target) | Refresh token via `getToken()`, reconnect |
| `4002` | Permission Revoked | Vehicle ownership revoked while connected (e.g., invite removed) | Surface to UI; do not auto-retry the same vehicle (DV-09) |
| `4003` | Server Overload | Per-vehicle or per-user backpressure cap exceeded | Auto-reconnect with extended backoff |
| `4004` | Protocol Violation | Client sent a malformed frame or violated the atomic-group contract | Surface to UI as a bug; do not auto-retry |
| `4005` | Snapshot Required | Server cannot satisfy the requested `subscribe.sinceSeq` (gap too large) -- client must re-fetch the REST snapshot (paired with `error.code = snapshot_required`) | Run the standard reconnect sequence (§7.2) |

The mapping between `error.payload.code` and the close code, when both are emitted:

| `error.code` | Following close code today | Target close code |
|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| `auth_failed` | `1008` Policy Violation | `1008` (no change) |
| `auth_timeout` | `1008` Policy Violation | `4001` Auth Token Expired (DV-06) |
| `permission_denied` | n/a today | `4002` Permission Revoked (DV-07) |
| `vehicle_not_owned` | n/a today | `4002` Permission Revoked (DV-07) |
| `rate_limited` | HTTP 429 on upgrade (DV-08) | `4003` Server Overload (DV-07/DV-08) |
| `snapshot_required` | n/a today | `4005` Snapshot Required (DV-02) |
| `internal_error` | n/a today | `1011` Internal Error |

### 6.3 No P1 in error messages

Per [`data-classification.md`](data-classification.md) §2.2 and Rule CG-DC-2: the `error.payload.message` field is **P0**, but error message construction sites MUST NOT include P1 values (no GPS, no addresses, no tokens, no email, no full VINs). Use opaque IDs (vehicleId, driveId, userId) for correlation, or `redactVIN()` for VINs that absolutely must appear.

The current implementation in [`handler.go:sendError`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) emits only static strings (`"invalid token"`, `"failed to load vehicles"`) and is therefore compliant. Future error codes MUST preserve this property; contract-guard Rule CG-DC-2 blocks PRs that introduce P1 values into error construction sites.

---

## 7. Heartbeat, reconnect, and snapshot resume

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.10, NFR-3.11, NFR-3.12, NFR-3.13, FR-8.1.

### 7.1 Reconnect backoff parameters (NFR-3.10)

These are the canonical values from [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.4 and MUST be implemented identically in both SDKs:

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Initial delay | 1 second | First reconnect attempt after disconnect |
| Backoff multiplier | 2x | Each subsequent attempt doubles the delay |
| Maximum delay | 30 seconds | Cap regardless of attempt count |
| Jitter | ± 25% of computed delay | Prevents thundering herd at the 5K concurrent client target (NFR-3.6) |
| Maximum retries | Unlimited (default) | SDK retries indefinitely unless `USER_STOPPED` or consumer configures a limit |

```
delay          = min(initialDelay * 2^(attempt - 1), maxDelay)
jitter         = delay * random(-0.25, +0.25)
effectiveDelay = delay + jitter
```

### 7.2 Reconnect sequence

The full sequence diagram is in [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §5. The protocol-relevant invariants:

1. **Snapshot before stream (NFR-3.11).** On reconnect, the SDK MUST re-fetch the REST snapshot ([`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) `GET /vehicles/{id}/snapshot`) BEFORE processing any new WebSocket frames. The snapshot is the cold-load source of truth; the WebSocket stream resumes from the consistent baseline.
2. **All groups -> loading.** When the SDK begins the reconnect, every `dataState` group transitions to `loading` (state-machine D-7). Cached values remain visible per NFR-3.12 / NFR-3.13.
3. **No forced reload (NFR-3.12, NFR-3.13).** The reconnect is entirely SDK-internal. The UI is never asked to refresh. Cached state remains visible indefinitely.
4. **Ordering guarantee.** Live frames received during the snapshot fetch are queued and applied AFTER the snapshot, NEVER before (CG-SM-4).
5. **Idempotent.** Multiple rapid disconnect/reconnect cycles MUST NOT cause duplicate snapshot fetches. The SDK cancels any in-flight fetch when a new reconnect begins.

The reconnect handshake replays §2 verbatim: open WSS, send `auth` frame, await live frames.

### 7.3 Snapshot-resume semantics (NFR-3.11)

NFR-3.11 says: "On reconnect, SDK MUST re-fetch the DB snapshot and resume live stream without user intervention."

Two valid implementations, the contract supports both:

1. **REST-snapshot resume (current v1.0 implementation).** Reconnect always fetches the full REST snapshot. No wire-level sequence numbers. Trade-off: extra HTTP round-trip on every reconnect, gaps within a single connection are invisible.
2. **Sequence-resume (PLANNED, v1.x, DV-02).** When the server emits envelope `seq`, the client passes its highest-seen `seq` as `subscribe.sinceSeq` (§5.2). The server replays missed frames OR responds with `error.code: snapshot_required` to fall back to mode 1. Trade-off: requires server-side per-connection retention of recent frames.

The SDK contract today is mode 1. The wire surface for mode 2 is reserved so v1.x can ship without a breaking change.

### 7.4 Heartbeat / keepalive

> **Anchored:** NFR-3.10 (reconnect cadence constraint).

| Direction | Cadence | Wire form | Source (Go) |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Server -> client | Default 15 seconds (configurable via `WebSocketConfig.HeartbeatInterval`; validated `> 0` in `config/validate.go` line 104) | Bare envelope `{"type":"heartbeat"}` (no `payload` key -- `omitempty`) | [`heartbeat.go:RunHeartbeat`](../../internal/ws/heartbeat.go) |
| Client -> server | None today (PLANNED `ping` per §5.4 / DV-07) | n/a | n/a |
| Transport-level (RFC 6455 PING/PONG) | Handled transparently by `coder/websocket` library | Binary control frames | Library internals |

The server pre-marshals the heartbeat message once at init (`heartbeatMessage = mustMarshal(wsMessage{Type: msgTypeHeartbeat})`) and broadcasts it via [`Hub.BroadcastAll`](../../internal/ws/hub.go) line 90 to ALL connected clients regardless of vehicle ownership.

#### 7.4.1 SDK liveness watchdog

The SDK uses the heartbeat as a positive liveness signal:

- Reset a watchdog timer on EVERY received frame (heartbeat, vehicle_update, anything).
- If the watchdog fires (no frame for `2 * heartbeatInterval`, default 30 s), the SDK treats it as a silent disconnect and triggers `WS_CLOSED` -> `connecting` (C-6 -> C-9).

Per Rule CG-SM-1 ([`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §7), the watchdog MUST NOT be used to mark `dataState` as `stale`. `dataState` transitions to `stale` only when the WebSocket actually closes (NFR-3.7, NFR-3.8b).

**Two-watchdog model.** The liveness watchdog described above is the **post-`auth_ok`** mechanism: it is armed on receipt of `auth_ok` and reset on every subsequent frame. Before `auth_ok` arrives, a separate **pre-`auth_ok` timer** is in effect (§2.3 rule 4) — a 6-second bound starting when the SDK hands the `auth` frame to the socket. The two timers never overlap: the pre-`auth_ok` timer is cancelled the moment `auth_ok` arrives or C-3 fires, whichever happens first; the liveness watchdog is armed at that same moment. Any "no frame" window between `connecting` and `connected` is covered by the pre-`auth_ok` timer; every "no frame" window after `connected` is covered by the liveness watchdog. Together they bound the end-user "Connecting..." banner to at most 6 s on degraded paths and bound silent data-plane stalls to at most 30 s.

#### 7.4.2 SDK MUST NOT use heartbeat for freshness

Per NFR-3.7, freshness is event-driven and not time-based. The SDK MUST NOT:

- Mark fields stale because no `vehicle_update` for that field arrived in the last N heartbeats.
- Use heartbeat cadence to derive any `dataState` transition.

The only legitimate uses of heartbeat in the SDK are: (a) reset the liveness watchdog, (b) update an internal "last frame received" timestamp for debug telemetry.

## 9. Type generation targets

### 9.1 TypeScript (AsyncAPI -> TS types)

The `gen-ts-ws-types` Makefile target (PLANNED) will invoke an AsyncAPI -> TypeScript generator against [`specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml`](specs/websocket.asyncapi.yaml) and write the result to `sdk/typescript/src/types/ws-messages.ts`. The generator MUST consume the linked JSON Schemas via `$ref` rather than inlining. Drift between the generated file and the spec fails CI.

### 9.2 Swift (AsyncAPI -> Codable structs)

Per NFR-3.34, the Swift SDK uses `Codable`/`Sendable` structs. A code generator (PLANNED) will produce one struct per `$defs` entry in [`schemas/ws-messages.schema.json`](schemas/ws-messages.schema.json) plus the envelope from [`schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json`](schemas/ws-envelope.schema.json). The discriminator is implemented as an enum-with-associated-values per Swift idiom.

## 10. Code ↔ spec divergences

This section is the canonical catalogue of every known gap between this contract and the current `internal/ws/` implementation (or between this contract and `requirements.md`). Every entry has a Linear follow-up title; contract-tester treats any un-catalogued divergence as a failing contract violation. The divergence IDs (DV-NN) are stable -- new divergences take the next free number; closed divergences retain their ID in the change log.

### Status legend

Read this legend before scanning the catalogue. A row's **Status** column classifies the action it requires:

| Status | Meaning | Blocks merge of this PR? | Action |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|--------|
| **RESOLVED** | Contract frozen AND implementation matches. | No | Audit-trail only; no further action. |
| **RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)** | Contract frozen; server/SDK wiring in flight. | No | Follow-up implementation issue referenced in the row. |
| **Requirement amendment pending** | Contract text is correct but `requirements.md` literal disagrees. | No | Separate `requirements.md` amendment PR -- this contract ships ahead of that PR by design (§10 rule 4). |
| **Open** | Known gap; neither contract nor implementation has landed the target. | No | Follow-up implementation issue referenced in the row. |
| **Open (reduced)** | A sub-slice of a larger `Open` divergence has been pulled out and resolved; the remainder is still open. | No | Same as `Open`; see the row for scope. |
| **New** | Divergence added in the same PR that introduces this section's row. | No | Same as `Open`. |

`contract-guard` treats any undocumented divergence as a failing contract violation -- this legend exists so a reader can tell at a glance which rows are informational (audit trail) and which are actionable (follow-ups).

### Catalogue

|----|--------|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------|------------------------------|
| **DV-01** | **Requirement amendment pending** | Nav debounce 200 ms (NFR-3.2 literal) vs 500 ms (implementation + Tesla floor) | `defaultNavFlushInterval = 500 * time.Millisecond` ([`nav_accumulator.go`](../../internal/ws/nav_accumulator.go) line 12). Tesla emits field batches in **500 ms buckets on the vehicle side**, and Fleet API `interval_seconds` has a **1-second minimum** -- sub-second emission cannot even be requested. | **Amend NFR-3.2 in [`docs/architecture/requirements.md`](../architecture/requirements.md) from 200 ms to 500 ms.** This is a **requirement-drift divergence**, not an implementation-drift divergence: the server is correct and the requirement was authored without knowledge of Tesla's 500 ms batch floor. See §3.2.1 for the full justification. MYR-11 ships with DV-01 still marked "amendment pending"; a separate NFR-3.2 amendment PR is required to fully close DV-01. | NFR-3.2, §3.2.1 | `MYR-XX Amend NFR-3.2: nav debounce window 200 ms -> 500 ms (Tesla 500 ms bucket floor)` |
| **DV-02** | Open | Envelope `seq` + `ts` not emitted | Server has no per-connection sequence counter; no envelope-level timestamp. Payload-internal `timestamp` is the only time source. | Server adds a `nextSeq` counter to `Client`, increments on every `Hub.Broadcast`/`BroadcastAll`, and includes it plus `ts` (server `time.Now().UTC()`) in every envelope. SDK tolerates absence today; consumes once emitted. | NFR-3.11, §3.1, §3.3 | `MYR-XX Add monotonic per-connection seq + envelope ts to WebSocket frames (NFR-3.11)` |
| **DV-03** | **RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)** | `chargeState` in charge group | Not emitted, not persisted, not in `vehicle-state-schema.md` (previously deferred in §7.1). | **v1 ships `chargeState` as a member of the `charge` atomic group.** Tesla emits `ChargeState` natively as proto field **2** (enum: `Unknown`, `Disconnected`, `NoPower`, `Starting`, `Charging`, `Complete`, `Stopped`). Follow-up implementation issue: add `FleetFieldChargeState` to [`internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go`](../../internal/telemetry/fleet_api_fields.go), extend decoder mapping, add DB column (P0, non-encrypted), wire through `field_mapping.go`. See §4.1.4 for the full wire contract. | NFR-3.1, §4.1.4 | `MYR-XX Implement chargeState wire field (v1 charge atomic group)` |
| **DV-04** | **RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)** | `timeToFull` in charge group | Not emitted, not persisted. Previous `vehicle-state-schema.md` §7.1 entry claimed this field was "not available from Tesla Fleet Telemetry" -- **this claim was factually wrong.** Tesla emits `TimeToFullCharge` natively as proto field **43** (`double`). **Unit is HOURS, not seconds** -- the `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill's `data-fields-and-protobuf.md` §"TimeToFullCharge" documents it as "Estimated hours to reach charge limit", and the legacy Tesla REST API `time_to_full_charge` is also in hours. A prior commit on this branch incorrectly labeled the unit as seconds; this has been corrected across all contract files in response to the MYR-11 Tesla SME audit. Empirical verification via a charging-vehicle protobuf capture is tracked as **DV-17**. | **v1 ships `timeToFull` as a member of the `charge` atomic group with unit `hours` (decimal double).** The follow-up implementation issue can be bundled with DV-03's (same pipeline changes). Corrected the incorrect claim in `vehicle-state-schema.md` line 333 as part of this PR. See §4.1.4 for the full wire contract. Note that Tesla also exposes `EstimatedHoursToChargeTermination` (proto field 190) as a related "simple" ETA that always targets `ChargeLimitSoc`; proto 43 is the v1 source because it is trip-aware (time-to-trip-ready during Trip Planner sessions) -- delineation and decision rationale resolved by [MYR-28](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-28) on 2026-04-21, see `vehicle-state-schema.md` §7.1 for the full comparison and citations. | NFR-3.1, §4.1.4 | `MYR-XX Implement timeToFull wire field (v1 charge atomic group, hours)` |
| **DV-05** | **RESOLVED** | Fixture files for every message type | **RESOLVED by MYR-13.** 35 canonical fixtures authored across `websocket/`, `rest/`, `atomic-groups/`, and `edge-cases/` directories. Every `type` in §4 / §5 has at least one happy-path fixture. Edge cases cover nav clear, 0,0 GPS sentinel, null gear, spec-only nulls, active charging, micro-drive, and device_cap. Includes `auth_ok.json` and the four-field charge group. `contract-tester` wiring is a follow-up. | (Resolved -- see [`fixtures/README.md`](fixtures/README.md) for the full index.) | NFR-3.45, §4 catalog | `MYR-13 Create canonical contract fixtures for conformance testing` |
| **DV-06** | Open | `auth_timeout` close code conflated with `auth_failed` | Both errors close with `websocket.StatusPolicyViolation` (1008). SDK has to read the `error.code` to decide retry policy; fragile if the error frame races the close. | Map `auth_timeout` to a dedicated close code (proposed: `4001` Auth Token Expired) so SDKs can branch on the close code alone. Requires updating `handler.go:handleUpgrade` error path + SDK close-code switch. | FR-7.1, FR-7.3, §6.2 | `MYR-XX Emit distinct close code for auth_timeout vs auth_failed` |
| **DV-07** | Open (reduced) | Client control frames (`subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`ping`/`pong`) and typed `permission_denied` | `readPump` ignores all post-auth client frames. Per-vehicle routing is implicit at handshake time. No typed error frame for `permission_denied`/`vehicle_not_owned`. | Implement `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` for per-vehicle routing, `sinceSeq` resume (depends on DV-02), and typed `permission_denied` / `vehicle_not_owned` error frames with corresponding close code 4002. **Note: `auth_ok` has been pulled OUT of DV-07 and is v1-required** -- see the new §2.3 / §4 catalog entry and the RESOLVED divergence is not tracked separately (the wire contract is the trigger for the implementation issue). | FR-8.1, NFR-3.21, §5 | `MYR-XX Implement per-vehicle subscribe/unsubscribe + permission_denied error frame` |
| **DV-08** | **RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)** | Per-IP and per-user connection caps | `HandlerConfig.MaxConnectionsPerIP` exists in [`handler.go`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) line 33 and `handleUpgrade` checks it, but [`cmd/telemetry-server/main.go`](../../cmd/telemetry-server/main.go) line 178 constructs `HandlerConfig` without populating it. `WebSocketConfig.MaxConnectionsPerUser` (default **5**, [`internal/config/defaults.go`](../../internal/config/defaults.go) line 67) exists but is not threaded into the handler either. | **Ship both caps:** per-IP **64** (pre-auth, breach -> HTTP 429, no WS handshake), per-user **5** (post-auth, breach -> `error` frame `code="rate_limited"` + close **4003 Server Overload**). See §1.3 for enforcement points and rationale and §6.1.1 for the `rate_limited` reconnect policy. The wiring change is a follow-up implementation issue. | NFR-3.6, §1.3, §6.1.1, §6.2 | `MYR-XX Wire MaxConnectionsPerIP (64) + MaxConnectionsPerUser (5) into HandlerConfig with asymmetric enforcement` |
| **DV-09** | Open | Vehicle ownership snapshot stale mid-connection | `Client.vehicleIDs` is captured at handshake time. Revoking an invite while a viewer is connected does not stop that viewer's stream until reconnection. | Add a hub-side ownership refresh hook (server-pushed) OR force-disconnect affected clients with close code `4002`. Needs a mechanism for the sharing service to notify the hub. | NFR-3.21, FR-5.3, §4.5 | `MYR-XX Refresh WebSocket client vehicle scope on invite revocation` |
| **DV-10** | Open | `speed` not in GPS atomic group | `requirements.md` NFR-3.1 lists `speed` in the GPS group. [`vehicle-state-schema.md`](vehicle-state-schema.md) §7.1 resolves `speed` as ungrouped (2 s cadence vs. 10 m GPS delta filter). Server delivers `speed` independently. | Amend NFR-3.1 in `requirements.md` to reflect the resolved decision. No wire change needed. | NFR-3.1, §4.1.7 | `MYR-XX Amend NFR-3.1 to remove speed from GPS atomic group` |
| **DV-11** | **RESOLVED** | `drive_ended` wire payload is summary-only (FR-3.4 scope split) | Server emits summary fields only; full FR-3.4 fields are persisted in `Drive` and fetched via REST `GET /drives/{id}`. | **v1 ships the summary on the wire + an explicit `fetchDrive(driveId)` SDK helper** (unanimous recommendation from sdk-typescript and sdk-swift). Target SDK API: `client.onDriveEnded(cb)` + `await client.fetchDrive(id)` + TS `useDrive(id)` React hook + Swift `client.fetchDrive(_:)` async method. REST endpoint is `GET /drives/{id}` -- authoritative reference is [`rest-api.md`](rest-api.md) (placeholder until that doc is authored; see README index). No wire change; documented in §4.3 and [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §3.3 / §4.1. | FR-3.1, FR-3.4, §4.3 | (No implementation issue needed for server; TS/Swift SDK issues implement `fetchDrive`.) |
| **DV-12** | **RESOLVED** | `drive_ended.duration` string format dropped | **Resolved by [MYR-32](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-32).** Server now emits `durationSeconds` (float64, `DriveStats.Duration.Seconds()`) on the `drive_ended` wire frame. The Go `time.Duration.String()` format is no longer emitted. `messages.go` struct field renamed from `Duration string` to `DurationSeconds float64` with JSON tag `"durationSeconds"`. `broadcaster.go:handleDriveEnded` calls `.Seconds()` instead of `.String()`. Tests verify the JSON key name and float64 roundtrip. | (Resolved.) | FR-3.4 ergonomics, §4.3 | [`MYR-32`](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-32) — Emit drive_ended.durationSeconds (replace duration string) |
| **DV-13** | **Requirement amendment pending** | `tripStartTime` atomic group membership | `requirements.md` NFR-3.1 lists `tripStartTime` as a member of the *navigation* atomic group. There is no Tesla field for `tripStartTime`; it is derived from the drive detector's `started_at` timestamp in [`internal/drives/`](../../internal/drives/). | **Relocate `tripStartTime` from the `navigation` group to the `drive` group** in NFR-3.1. The drive group is delivered via `drive_started` (not `vehicle_update`), so `tripStartTime` is naturally carried as `drive_started.payload.startedAt` -- see §4.2. MYR-11 ships with DV-13 still marked "amendment pending"; a separate NFR-3.1 amendment PR is required to fully close DV-13. (Bundling with DV-01 is fine if the architect prefers one amendment PR for both.) | NFR-3.1, §4.2 | `MYR-XX Amend NFR-3.1: relocate tripStartTime from navigation group to drive group` |
| **DV-14** | **New** | Slow-auth attack mitigation | Neither the per-IP nor the per-user cap (DV-08 target) defends against a slow-auth attack where each TCP connection sits under the per-IP cap but holds the 5 s `AuthTimeout` window. An attacker can still saturate the upgrade path by opening connections just below the concurrent cap and letting them idle through the auth deadline. | Add EITHER (a) a dedicated pre-auth rate-limit on upgrade *attempts* (token-bucket over a 1-minute window, independent of the concurrent-connection count), OR (b) a shortened `AuthTimeout` under load (e.g. drop from 5 s to 1 s when `hub.ipConnectionCount` for the source IP exceeds a soft threshold). Architect + security to decide which. This is a secondary mitigation to DV-08 and does not block v1 ship, but must be tracked so it is not forgotten. | NFR-3.6, §1.3 | `MYR-XX Add slow-auth attack mitigation (pre-auth upgrade rate limit OR adaptive AuthTimeout)` |
| **DV-15** | **RESOLVED** | state-machine.md C-3 trigger alignment | [`state-machine.md`](state-machine.md) §1.3 previously defined C-3 (`connecting -> connected`) as triggered by "first data frame OR heartbeat arrives", because it was authored before `auth_ok` was pulled into v1. **Owner:** [MYR-31](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-31) (`Agent/sdk-architect`). | **RESOLVED by MYR-31.** `state-machine.md` §1.3 C-3 now reads `AUTH_OK_RECEIVED` with guard "Server sends `auth_ok` frame". §1.1 Mermaid diagram, §4.1 message catalog, §4.2 event-to-transition mapping, and §5.1 reconnect sequence diagram all updated. Both docs now agree: C-3 is triggered by receipt of `auth_ok`. | FR-8.1, §2.3, §2.4 | [`MYR-31`](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-31) — Amend state-machine.md C-3 trigger: first-frame -> auth_ok receipt |
| **DV-16** | **RESOLVED** | `auth_ok` frame emission | **Resolved by [MYR-33](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-33).** Server now emits `auth_ok` as the first server-to-client frame after `Hub.Register` succeeds. Implementation: [`handler.go:sendAuthOk`](../../internal/ws/handler.go) called from `handleUpgrade` on the success path, before the readPump/writePump handoff. Wire shape matches §2.3 (`userId`, `vehicleCount`, `issuedAt`). Tests assert `auth_ok` is the first frame on success and is NOT emitted on failure paths. | (Resolved.) | FR-6.1, §2.3, §2.4 | [`MYR-33`](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-33) — Emit auth_ok frame from handler.go:authenticateClient on success |
| **DV-17** | **New** (research) | Empirical `timeToFull` unit verification | Tesla's `vehicle_data.proto:57` declares `TimeToFullCharge` as `double` with no inline unit annotation. Every secondary source (tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme skill, legacy Tesla REST API `time_to_full_charge`) documents the unit as **hours (decimal)**. The contract assumes hours on that basis. An empirical capture against a charging Tesla (or simulator replay of a real-vehicle protobuf sample) is the only way to settle the unit with certainty. This was explicitly the failure mode that triggered the audit: an earlier MYR-11 commit labeled the unit as "seconds" with no source and was only caught by the post-hoc Tesla SME audit. **Owner:** [MYR-25](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-25) (`Agent/tesla-telemetry` + `Agent/testing`) — filed 2026-04-14 with the capture-and-verify acceptance criteria. | Run a capture-and-verify session against a charging Tesla OR against the teslamotors/fleet-telemetry repo's test fixtures OR via a targeted issue to Tesla's fleet-telemetry maintainers. Accept the observed unit as ground truth. If observed unit disagrees with "hours", correct the contract (wire `timeToFull`, SDK type-gen output, fixtures) BEFORE any SDK build ships. Must land before DV-04 implementation PR. | NFR-3.1, §4.1.4 | [`MYR-25`](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-25) — Verify TimeToFullCharge unit empirically against charging vehicle |
| **DV-18** | **RESOLVED** | `FieldChargeState` internal constant collision | **Resolved by [MYR-26](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-26).** The existing `FieldChargeState` constant (which mapped to proto 179 `DetailedChargeState`) has been renamed to `FieldDetailedChargeState` with internal name `"detailedChargeState"`. A new `FieldChargeState` constant now correctly maps to proto field 2 (`Field_ChargeState`) with internal name `"chargeState"`. Both constants are in `fieldMap`; the new `FieldChargeState` is intentionally not yet in `DefaultFieldConfig` — fleet API configuration is added by the DV-03 implementation PR. | (Resolved.) | NFR-3.1, §4.1.4 | [`MYR-26`](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-26) — Resolve FieldChargeState constant collision before DV-03 wiring |

### Divergence management rules

1. **One-way door for the catalogue.** A new divergence MUST be added to this table in the same PR that introduces the gap. `contract-guard` treats an undocumented divergence between this doc and `internal/ws/` as merge-blocking drift.
2. **Closing a divergence.** When a follow-up PR fully resolves a divergence, mark the row's **Status** column as **RESOLVED** and add a one-line entry in the change log (§11) referencing the resolving PR and Linear issue. RESOLVED rows are **retained** in the table for audit-trail continuity. Do NOT reuse a DV-NN number even if its row is later deleted.
3. **RESOLVED-with-implementation-pending.** A divergence may be marked RESOLVED at the contract level (the target shape is locked and documented here) while the implementation follow-up is still in flight. In that case, the Status column carries the qualifier "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" and the row references the implementation issue. Once the implementation lands, the qualifier is dropped.
4. **Amendment divergences.** DV entries that propose to amend `requirements.md` (currently DV-01, DV-10, DV-13) carry the status "**Requirement amendment pending**" until the amendment PR lands. They MUST be resolved in one of two ways: ship the change, or land a `requirements.md` amendment PR that updates the NFR literal. "Leave it as drift forever" is not an option. MYR-11 is explicitly permitted to merge with DV-01 and DV-13 in "amendment pending" state because (a) the wire contract is already consistent with the correct values, and (b) the amendment PRs are out-of-scope for MYR-11's change footprint.

## 11. Change log

| Date | Change | Author |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2026-04-13 | Initial full draft (closed PR #166): handshake, envelope, server->client and client->server catalogs, error/close-code matrix, heartbeat/reconnect/snapshot semantics, AsyncAPI 3.0 spec, sibling JSON Schemas, §10 open questions. Authored by a general-purpose agent role-playing `sdk-architect`; closed by the user for re-do with the real subagent. | general-purpose (role-played) |
| 2026-04-13 | **Authoritative rewrite by the registered `sdk-architect` subagent.** (1) Corrected the anchored-requirements table: fixed FR-8.1/FR-8.2 labels, added FR-7.3, NFR-3.9, NFR-3.12, NFR-3.13 anchors. (2) Fixed the `MaxConnectionsPerIP` wiring claim: it is **not** populated by `main.go` today, so the per-IP cap is unwired. Recorded as DV-08. (3) Added the `charge`/`gps`/`gear` non-accumulator server flow explanation to §3.2 (only nav has a dedicated debounce). (4) Replaced §10 "open questions" with a formal "Code ↔ spec divergences" catalogue with stable DV-NN IDs and divergence-management rules. (5) Added new divergences: DV-03 (`chargeState`), DV-04 (`timeToFull`), DV-06 (`auth_timeout` close-code conflation), DV-10 (`speed` ungrouped), DV-11 (`drive_ended` FR-3.4 scope split), DV-12 (`duration` string format), DV-13 (`tripStartTime`). (6) Tightened §6.1.1 to separate today/planned + reconnect policy columns, added `snapshot_required` reserved code. (7) Added forward-compat open-object rule to §3.1 for FR-1.3. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-13 | **v1 contract freeze (second pass).** Specialist decisions from `tesla-telemetry`, `security`, `sdk-typescript`, `sdk-swift` applied: **DV-01** recast as requirement-drift (NFR-3.2 literal 200 ms is wrong; Tesla 500 ms bucket + 1 s `interval_seconds` minimum is the floor; NFR-3.2 amendment pending). **DV-03, DV-04 RESOLVED** -- `chargeState` (proto field 2, enum) and `timeToFull` (proto field 43, double seconds) added to the v1 charge atomic group; `vehicle-state-schema.md` line 333 factually-wrong "not available from Tesla Fleet Telemetry" claim corrected. **DV-08 RESOLVED** (target documented; wiring still pending): both caps ship with asymmetric enforcement -- per-IP 64 (pre-auth, HTTP 429) + per-user 5 (post-auth, error frame + close 4003). **DV-11 RESOLVED** -- summary on wire + `fetchDrive(driveId)` SDK helper (unanimous SDK recommendation). **DV-12 RESOLVED** -- `duration` string dropped, `durationSeconds` number replaces it. **DV-13** recast as requirement-drift (`tripStartTime` relocated from navigation group to drive group; carried as `drive_started.payload.startedAt`; NFR-3.1 amendment pending). **auth_ok** pulled out of DV-07 and made v1-required (new §2.3 content; C-3 trigger is now `auth_ok` receipt; rest of DV-07 remains open for `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`ping`/`pong` + typed `permission_denied`). **New divergences added:** **DV-14** (slow-auth attack mitigation follow-up to DV-08) and **DV-15** (`state-machine.md` C-3 trigger alignment follow-up). Cross-contract updates to `vehicle-state-schema.md` §2.2 and §7.1. AsyncAPI spec + `ws-envelope.schema.json` + `ws-messages.schema.json` updated in lockstep. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-13 | **PR #167 review pass.** Addresses Claude Review warnings (3) and ux-audit + Claude Review nice-to-haves (7). (1) Updated DV-03, DV-04, DV-12 Status column to "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" to match the §10 Rule 3 qualifier convention that DV-08 already uses. (2) Added **DV-16** for the `auth_ok` frame emission gap: server has zero `auth_ok` references in `internal/ws/` today, so an SDK that implements §2.3 rule 4 literally will hit its 6-second pre-`auth_ok` timer on every connection. DV-16 status is "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)". (3) Updated the §4 catalog `auth_ok` row Source cell from the clever-paren rationale to a plain `(target; see DV-16)` reference. (4) Added a paragraph after §3.1's open-object rule clarifying that `additionalProperties: false` in the JSON Schemas is the contract-tester invariant, not a runtime SDK rule. (5) Added a perceptual-smoothness scope note to §3.2.1 explaining the 500 ms debounce applies only to the nav group and that GPS/position updates arrive on Tesla's per-field cadence, independent of nav. (6) Added a C-3 inline gloss to §2.3 rule 1 so a reader does not have to tab-switch to state-machine.md. (7) Added SDK type-gen guidance (`string | null` / `Optional<String>`) and null-placeholder UI prose (`--`, not a spinner) for `chargeState` / `timeToFull` in §4.1.4. (8) Added a `rate_limited` reconnect pseudocode block + a `rate_limited.device_cap` typed sub-code to §6.1.1 so per-user cap breaches surface an actionable "too many devices" UI signal instead of a generic rate-limit toast. `ErrorPayload.subCode` added to `ws-messages.schema.json` with the `device_cap` enum. (9) Added a status legend above the §10 catalogue so a reader can classify rows as `RESOLVED` / `RESOLVED (wiring pending)` / `Requirement amendment pending` / `Open` / `New` at a glance. (10) Added an audit-trail footnote under `data-classification.md` §6 "By tier" summary recording MYR-11 as the source of the P0 count bump 83 -> 85. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-16 RESOLVED by [MYR-33](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-33).** Server now emits `auth_ok` as the first frame after `Hub.Register` succeeds (`handler.go:sendAuthOk`). §4 catalog row updated from `(target; see DV-16)` to `handler.go:sendAuthOk`. §10 DV-16 status flipped from "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" to "RESOLVED". | go-engineer |
| 2026-04-14 | **Tesla SME audit corrections.** After the MYR-11 freeze commit landed, a trust-but-verify audit by the `tesla-telemetry` subagent against the `tesla-fleet-telemetry-sme` skill and the vendored `vehicle_data.proto` found three errors, all stemming from the same "claim-without-citation" failure mode that caused the original MYR-8 `timeToFull` incident. **Fix 1 — `timeToFull` unit (CRITICAL):** §4.1.4 and every cross-contract reference labeled the unit as "seconds". The SME skill documents it as **hours (decimal)** and the legacy Tesla REST API `time_to_full_charge` is also in hours. Corrected across §4.1.4, `vehicle-state-schema.md` §1.1/§2.2/§7.1, `data-classification.md` §1.3, `vehicle-state.schema.json` (added `chargeState` and `timeToFull` field definitions — the JSON Schema had NOT been updated in the previous freeze pass, a separate drift the audit also caught), and the AsyncAPI example (5400 seconds → 1.5 hours). **Fix 2 — fabricated protobuf identifier:** §3.2 and `vehicle-state-schema.md` §2.2 referenced a type name `VehicleTelemetryEvent.Fields` that does not exist in the Tesla proto. Tesla's actual top-level message is `Payload` with repeated `Datum` entries. Corrected to reference the real type. **Fix 3 — sourceless `interval_seconds` claim:** §3.2.1 claimed Tesla enforces a 1-second minimum and cited our own `fleet_api_fields.go` lines as authority. The 1-second value is OUR highest-cadence request, not a published Tesla floor. Reworded to distinguish REQUESTED cadence from the DELIVERED-as-one-message cadence (500 ms Tesla vehicle-side bucket). **New divergences added:** **DV-17** — empirical unit verification of `TimeToFullCharge` via charging-vehicle protobuf capture, required before any SDK build generates types against `timeToFull`. **DV-18** — `FieldChargeState` internal constant collision: `internal/telemetry/fields.go` already uses that name for proto 179 (`DetailedChargeState`); the DV-03 implementation PR must rename the existing constant before adding a new one for proto 2. Flagged as a Go-side trap the contract doc cannot fix on its own. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-15 RESOLVED** by MYR-31. `state-machine.md` §1.3 C-3 trigger amended from "first data frame OR heartbeat" to "receipt of `auth_ok`". Both docs now agree on the canonical C-3 trigger. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-12 RESOLVED by [MYR-32](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-32).** Server now emits `durationSeconds` (float64) instead of `duration` (Go string) on `drive_ended` frames. `messages.go` field renamed, `broadcaster.go` calls `.Seconds()` instead of `.String()`. §10 DV-12 status flipped from "RESOLVED (target documented; wiring still pending)" to "RESOLVED". | go-engineer |
| 2026-04-15 | **DV-18 RESOLVED by [MYR-26](https://linear.app/myrobotaxi/issue/MYR-26).** Renamed `FieldChargeState` (proto 179) to `FieldDetailedChargeState`; added new `FieldChargeState` for proto field 2 (`Field_ChargeState`). The naming collision that would have blocked DV-03 wiring is eliminated. §10 DV-18 status flipped from "New (implementation trap)" to "RESOLVED". | go-engineer |
| 2026-04-15 | **MYR-27: Rename `fsdMilesToday` to `fsdMilesSinceReset`.** Wire field name in §3.2 ungrouped list, §4.1 rename table, and §4.1.7 ungrouped field list updated. Tesla's `SelfDrivingMilesSinceReset` does not reset daily; the cosmetic label was wrong. | sdk-architect |
| 2026-04-21 | **MYR-28: Delineate `TimeToFullCharge` (proto 43) vs `EstimatedHoursToChargeTermination` (proto 190).** Research confirmed proto 43 is trip-aware (reports time-to-trip-ready during Trip Planner sessions, time-to-`ChargeLimitSoc` otherwise) while proto 190 always reports the simple time-to-`ChargeLimitSoc`. Decision: keep proto 43 as the `timeToFull` source because trip-awareness matches the product UX "when will my car be done charging?". Updated §10 DV-04 to cross-reference the resolved delineation in `vehicle-state-schema.md` §7.1 (the canonical location for the full comparison + citations). No wire, schema, fixture, or Go code changes — proto 43 was already the source; this PR is pure documentation closing a research question MYR-11 left open. Empirical side-by-side capture folded into DV-17 (MYR-25). | sdk-architect |
