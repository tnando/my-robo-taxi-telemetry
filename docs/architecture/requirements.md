# MyRoboTaxi SDK v1 — Requirements

**Status:** Draft — awaiting review
**Owners:** tnando + sdk-architect agent
**Last updated:** 2026-04-04

This document captures the functional and non-functional requirements for the MyRoboTaxi SDK v1. Every subsequent contract doc, architectural decision, and PR is traceable back to this document.

---

## 1. North Star

Build a polished SDK that both web and iOS apps plug into, with comprehensive documentation and enforceable contracts. Stop the ping-pong between backend and frontend by making the SDK the single source of truth for data access. The UI becomes a dumb consumer.

**Design principles** (apply to every decision in this doc):

1. **Accuracy and performance first** — defaults must be right, don't expose perf knobs consumers have to tune.
2. **Atomicity** — logically-related fields are delivered together. UI never sees a half-changed group.
3. **Event-driven freshness** — staleness is signaled by explicit server events, not client-side timers.
4. **Extensibility as pattern, not architecture** — new telemetry fields are a data-model change + subscription wire-up, not an architectural change.
5. **Privacy-by-default** — raw telemetry is never persisted as a historical log. Application-level encryption for sensitive fields.
6. **Logic-only SDK** — no UI components, no map renderers, no styling. Consumers compose state with their own UI.
7. **Decoupled state** — connection state and per-field data freshness are independent concerns.
8. **Single source of truth** — every field has one source (DB or WebSocket), documented in the data lifecycle contract.

## 2. Functional Requirements (FRs)

### 2.1 Real-time vehicle state

**FR-1.1** SDK MUST stream live vehicle telemetry for: position, speed, heading, gear.
**FR-1.2** SDK MUST stream live charge state: battery level, charge state, estimated range.
**FR-1.3** SDK architecture MUST allow adding new telemetry fields (climate, doors, media, safety, etc.) via a mechanical data-model change, NOT an architectural change. Extensibility is tested by adding at least one new field post-v1 without modifying the SDK's core subscription mechanism.

**Out of scope for v1:** climate, doors/locks/sentry, media, TPMS, alerts.

### 2.2 Navigation state

**FR-2.1** SDK MUST expose: destination name, ETA (minutes to arrival), distance remaining, route polyline, origin location, trip start time.
**FR-2.2** Nav fields MUST be delivered as an atomic group — when any nav field changes, all correlated nav fields are updated together (see NFR-3).
**FR-2.3** When Tesla navigation is cancelled, the entire nav group MUST clear atomically — no stale destination, ETA, or polyline lingering.

**Out of scope for v1:** turn-by-turn maneuvers, lane guidance, rerouting hints.

### 2.3 Drive detection & history

**FR-3.1** SDK MUST emit live drive events: `drive_started`, `drive_updated` (per-point GPS updates), `drive_ended`.
**FR-3.2** SDK MUST expose paginated drive history (list of past drives with basic metadata).
**FR-3.3** SDK MUST expose per-drive route playback (full GPS trail for rendering on a map).
**FR-3.4** SDK MUST expose per-drive stats: distance, duration, avg/max speed, energy used (kWh), FSD miles driven, intervention count, start/end charge level, start/end location + address.
**FR-3.5** SDK MUST provide both a one-shot paginated fetch (for scrolling back) and a reactive subscription (latest drives auto-update when a drive completes).

### 2.4 Multi-vehicle support

**FR-4.1** v1 SDK supports a single active vehicle per user.
**FR-4.2** SDK public API signatures MUST be vehicle-scoped (e.g., `useVehicle(vehicleId)`) even in v1, so multi-vehicle support in v2 is purely additive — no API renames or breaking changes.

**Out of scope for v1:** switching active vehicles mid-session, multi-vehicle simultaneous streams.

### 2.5 Sharing & observability

**FR-5.1** SDK MUST support an invite flow: owner creates invite, recipient accepts, recipient becomes a read-only viewer.
**FR-5.2** SDK MUST expose a viewer list to owners (who has access, invite status).
**FR-5.3** SDK MUST support revoking viewer access.
**FR-5.4** Role model: `owner` (full read + write/commands) and `viewer` (full read, no write). Static field masks per role applied server-side.
**FR-5.5** Architecture MUST support adding a third role (e.g., `limited_viewer`) without schema changes.

**Out of scope for v1:** per-viewer custom field visibility, granular command permissions for viewers.

### 2.6 Authentication & token lifecycle

**FR-6.1** SDK MUST accept a `getToken: () => Promise<string>` callback from the consumer. SDK never stores credentials.
**FR-6.2** SDK MUST call `getToken()` on initial connection and on every auth error (401/expired).
**FR-6.3** SDK MUST NOT implement OAuth flows, token refresh logic, or credential storage. Those belong in the consumer's auth layer.

### 2.7 Error handling & recovery

**FR-7.1** SDK MUST expose typed error codes (e.g., `auth_expired`, `network_timeout`, `vehicle_offline`, `permission_denied`) so consumers branch without string-matching.
**FR-7.2** SDK MUST automatically retry transient errors (network blips, 5xx, timeouts) with exponential backoff.
**FR-7.3** Only terminal errors (auth expired, permission denied, vehicle not owned, persistent server failures) surface to the UI.

### 2.8 State machine exposed to consumers

**FR-8.1** SDK MUST expose two independent state dimensions:
- `connectionState`: `initializing | connecting | connected | disconnected | error`
- `dataState` per atomic field group: `loading | ready | stale | cleared | error`

**FR-8.2** The UI composes these two dimensions to render its own loading/error/stale presentation. SDK does not combine them into a single enum.

### 2.9 Historical data fetching

**FR-9.1** Drive history follows the real-time strategy: one-shot paginated fetch + reactive subscription for recency.
**FR-9.2** A completed drive MUST appear in the live drives list without the UI re-fetching.

### 2.10 User data controls

**FR-10.1** SDK/server MUST support user-initiated deletion of all user data: drive history, vehicle state snapshot, invites, active sessions.
**FR-10.2** Every deletion MUST write an immutable audit log entry: user ID, timestamp, what was deleted, initiator.

### 2.11 Observability (SDK-side)

**FR-11.1** SDK MUST expose structured logging with levels (debug/info/warn/error) via a pluggable logger interface. Default logger writes to console in debug mode, silent in production.
**FR-11.2** SDK MUST NEVER log sensitive data (tokens, GPS coordinates, destination addresses).
**FR-11.3** SDK MUST expose in-memory performance metrics: latency histograms per-message-type, reconnect counts, message counts, error rates, staleness events.
**FR-11.4** SDK MUST provide an optional OpenTelemetry hook. Consumers wire in their own OTel SDK; ours emits spans/metrics following OTel semantic conventions.
**FR-11.5** SDK MUST provide a debug mode that elevates logging, enables verbose metrics, and exposes internal state (current snapshot, pending subscriptions, connection state machine) via a debug API.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### 3.1 Latency targets (end-to-end Tesla → UI render)

| Event | Target | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Live telemetry updates** (GPS, speed, nav changes, drive events, battery, charge state, range) | **< 2s** | p95 measured at the consuming client |
| **Cold page load snapshot** (DB → UI first render) | **< 500ms** | No loading skeletons per-field; full state on first paint |
| **Live stream start** after page load | **< 1s** after auth completes | Time from `getToken()` resolution to first live message |
| **Nav change atomicity window** | **<= 200ms** | Server debounce window for grouping sibling field updates |

### 3.2 Atomicity contract

**NFR-3.1** Fields that change together MUST be delivered together. The server MUST group related telemetry updates into atomic messages.

**Atomic groups:**
- **Navigation**: destinationName, destinationLatitude, destinationLongitude, originLatitude, originLongitude, navRouteCoordinates, etaMinutes, tripDistanceRemaining, tripStartTime
- **Charge**: chargeLevel, chargeState, estimatedRange, timeToFull
- **GPS**: latitude, longitude, heading, speed
- **Gear**: gearPosition, derivedStatus (driving/parked)

**NFR-3.2** Server-side debounce: the broadcaster buffers sibling field updates for up to 200ms before emitting a single grouped message.
**NFR-3.3** DB snapshots MUST be self-consistent: if `destinationName` is present, `navRouteCoordinates` and `etaMinutes` for that destination MUST also be present, or all three are NULL.
**NFR-3.4** UI MUST NEVER see a partial group — e.g., showing a destination with no route.

### 3.3 DB snapshot completeness

**NFR-3.5** Every field the UI renders MUST be persisted to the DB. On cold page load, the snapshot MUST contain enough data to render the full UI without per-field loading spinners.
**NFR-3.6** If any UI-visible field is missing from the DB at page-load time, that is a bug in the persist path, not a display concern.

### 3.4 Freshness & staleness

**NFR-3.7** Freshness is event-driven, NOT time-based. The SDK MUST NOT use client-side TTL timers to mark data stale.
**NFR-3.8** Data is stale only when: (a) the server explicitly signaled a clear (nil value via WebSocket + NULL write to DB), or (b) the WebSocket is disconnected.
**NFR-3.9** When the server marks a field invalid, the SDK MUST apply the clear atomically within the affected group.

### 3.5 Reliability & connection lifecycle

**NFR-3.10** SDK MUST support automatic reconnect with exponential backoff (initial delay 1s, max delay 30s, jitter applied).
**NFR-3.11** On reconnect, SDK MUST re-fetch the DB snapshot and resume live stream without user intervention.
**NFR-3.12** SDK MUST gracefully tolerate offline mode: cached state from DB remains visible, connection state signals to the UI, no forced reloads.
**NFR-3.13** Offline tolerance: no maximum — cached data remains visible indefinitely until the user acts on it or reconnection succeeds.

### 3.6 Scale targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Users | 1,000 |
| Vehicles | 2,000 |
| Concurrent WebSocket clients | 5,000 |
| Telemetry throughput per vehicle | 1 Hz sustained, 10 Hz burst tolerance |

**NFR-3.14** Server architecture MUST be shardable — no in-memory singletons that can't scale horizontally.
**NFR-3.15** Broadcast fanout MUST NOT be O(n) over all clients per message. Per-vehicle subscription routing required.
**NFR-3.16** Event bus MUST be bounded with backpressure handling (drop-oldest or pause-producer policy documented).
**NFR-3.17** DB writes MUST be batched/coalesced to avoid hot-path writes per telemetry event.

### 3.7 Security & access control

**NFR-3.18** Role-based access control with two roles in v1: `owner`, `viewer`.
**NFR-3.19** Every WebSocket broadcast MUST be projected through the recipient's role mask before sending. No raw fan-out.
**NFR-3.20** Persisted DB reads MUST respect the viewer's role-based field visibility.
**NFR-3.21** Vehicle ownership MUST be enforced on every API call and every WebSocket subscription. Unauthorized access returns `permission_denied`.

### 3.8 Encryption

**NFR-3.22** **In transit**: all connections use TLS.
- Tesla → server: mTLS on port 443
- Server ↔ browsers/apps: WSS + HTTPS
- Server ↔ DB: TLS with `sslmode=require`
- Server ↔ Tesla Fleet API: HTTPS

**NFR-3.23** **At rest (application-level)**: AES-256-GCM column-level encryption for:
- Tesla OAuth `access_token` and `refresh_token` (`Account` table)
- GPS coordinates: `Vehicle.latitude`, `Vehicle.longitude`, `Drive.routePoints`, `Vehicle.navRouteCoordinates`
- Destination coordinates: `Vehicle.destinationLatitude`, `Vehicle.destinationLongitude`, `Vehicle.originLatitude`, `Vehicle.originLongitude`

**NFR-3.24** Encryption key stored as Fly.io secret (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`).
**NFR-3.25** Encryption is transparent to the SDK — the server store layer handles encrypt/decrypt. The SDK never sees ciphertext.
**NFR-3.26** Key rotation strategy documented in a separate contract doc.

### 3.9 Data classification

Every persisted field MUST be labeled with a classification tier in the contract docs:
- **P0** (Public): VIN's last-4, vehicle name, vehicle model. May appear in logs.
- **P1** (Sensitive, encrypted at rest): GPS coordinates, destination data, OAuth tokens. Never in logs.
- **P2** (Sensitive + access-logged): reserved for future use (e.g., payment info, health data if added).

### 3.10 Data retention

**NFR-3.27** **Drive records**: 1 year rolling window. Background job prunes drives older than 365 days.
**NFR-3.28** **Raw telemetry history**: NOT persisted. Only two persistence points:
- `Vehicle` row: current snapshot only, overwritten on update
- `Drive.routePoints`: GPS trail bounded by drive lifetime

**NFR-3.29** **Audit logs** (deletion events): retained indefinitely.

### 3.11 Developer experience & bundle size

**NFR-3.30** TypeScript SDK gzipped bundle: **< 75 KB** (hard budget, enforced in CI).
**NFR-3.31** Public API surface: **10-20 hooks/methods**. No kitchen-sink utilities.
**NFR-3.32** SDK is **logic-only**: no React components, no map renderers, no theming. Consumers compose state with their own UI.

### 3.12 Platform support

**TypeScript SDK** — supports:
- React (hooks layer, separate entry point)
- Vanilla TypeScript (core client, no React dependency)
- Node.js (SSR, scheduled tasks, server-side usage — no browser globals in core)
- React Native (shared code with web, no `window`/`document` in core)

**NFR-3.33** Core SDK uses a WebSocket abstraction that runs on browser `WebSocket`, Node `ws`, and React Native.

**Swift SDK** — supports:
- iOS 26+
- iPadOS 26+
- macOS (latest)
- watchOS
- visionOS

**NFR-3.34** Baseline: Swift 6, async/await, Observable state model, URLSession WebSocketTask (cross-platform).
**NFR-3.35** No UIKit dependencies (UI-layer-agnostic).
**NFR-3.36** watchOS constraint: aggressive lifecycle handling (background suspension, short-lived launches, incremental state hydration).

### 3.13 Versioning policy

**NFR-3.37** Strict semver. Breaking changes require a major version bump.
**NFR-3.38** Deprecated APIs remain functional for one full major version, emit runtime deprecation warnings.
**NFR-3.39** Migration guides published with every major release.
**NFR-3.40** Protocol-level multi-versioning (server supporting v1 + v2 simultaneously) is a v3+ concern, not v1.

### 3.14 Release cadence

**NFR-3.41** **Weekly scheduled releases** for stable SDK versions.
**NFR-3.42** **Hotfix lane** for critical bugs (security, data correctness) bypasses the weekly cycle.
**NFR-3.43** **Canary pre-releases** (`v1.x.x-canary.N`) tagged on every merge to main for internal dogfooding.
**NFR-3.44** Release notes auto-generated from PR labels (`breaking`, `feature`, `fix`, `chore`).

### 3.15 Test bench (ship-gate)

**NFR-3.45** Test bench is a **v1 ship-gate**, not a nice-to-have. All four layers below MUST pass before v1 ships.

1. **Contract conformance**: every WebSocket message type and REST endpoint validated against AsyncAPI/OpenAPI spec. SDK parsing verified against canonical fixtures.
2. **FR validation**: every FR has a deterministic test scenario (e.g., "set nav → UI reflects < 2s", "cancel nav → atomic clear", "reconnect → full state restored", "page load mid-drive → complete snapshot").
3. **NFR measurement**: automated latency measurements (p50/p95/p99), load tests at scale target (5K concurrent clients), bundle size check, memory/CPU budgets.
4. **Chaos scenarios**: server crash mid-drive, Tesla API 5xx, Tesla API stale data, token expiry mid-stream, network partition, WebSocket drops with varied backoff, auth server unavailable.

**NFR-3.46** Two test benches:
- **TUI test bench** (`cmd/testbench` in telemetry repo): backend/protocol validation, developer-facing.
- **Web test bench** (`my-robo-taxi-testbench` standalone repo): UI/SDK validation, user-facing, dogfoods the SDK.

### 3.16 Observability (server)

**NFR-3.47** Structured logs: slog JSON to stdout, ingested by a log aggregator (Loki/Datadog/Axiom).
**NFR-3.48** Prometheus metrics exposed on `:9090`, covering every pipeline stage.
**NFR-3.49** Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry: spans across receiver → event bus → broadcaster/store writer → WebSocket broadcast.
**NFR-3.50** SLO dashboards derived from latency contract (§3.1).
**NFR-3.51** SLO burn-rate alerts, error rate alerts, connection health alerts, auth failure spike alerts.

### 3.17 Documentation

**NFR-3.52** Markdown source in repo, published as a static site (Mintlify/Docusaurus/Nextra).
**NFR-3.53** API reference auto-generated via TypeDoc (TS) and DocC (Swift) on every release.
**NFR-3.54** Interactive examples (runnable sandboxes) for common flows.
**NFR-3.55** Hosted on Vercel or Cloudflare Pages.

### 3.18 Work tracking

**NFR-3.56** Linear is the source of truth for work tracking (epics, tickets, cycles).
**NFR-3.57** Branch names and PR titles include Linear ticket IDs for auto-linking.
**NFR-3.58** GitHub issues redirect to Linear after migration.

## 4. Data Migration Policy

**MP-1** Pre-launch, single-user state: the SDK v1 launch is a full reset. All existing drive records, vehicle state snapshots, and historical nav data are cleared.
**MP-2** v1 launches with a clean DB. Every row thereafter conforms to the new contract.
**MP-3** Post-v1, targeted backfills are permitted only for specific UX breaks, not prophylactically.

---

## 5. Out of Scope for v1 (Explicit)

To prevent scope creep, the following are explicitly deferred:

- Multi-vehicle simultaneous streams (v2)
- Per-viewer custom field visibility (v2)
- Climate, doors/locks, sentry mode, media telemetry (v2+)
- TPMS, alerts, errors stream (v2+)
- Turn-by-turn navigation maneuvers (v2+)
- Command-and-control (unlock, honk, climate-start, etc.) — read-only for v1
- Multi-region deployment
- Protocol-level multi-versioning
- Third-role access tier (`limited_viewer`)
- GPS data pseudonymization for analytics
- Real-time collaborative features (multiple viewers on same vehicle interacting)

---

## 6. Success Criteria (v1 Launch)

v1 is ready to launch when:

1. ✅ All FRs above have passing test bench scenarios
2. ✅ All NFR latency targets met at p95 in load tests
3. ✅ All four test bench layers (contract, FR, NFR, chaos) pass
4. ✅ TypeScript SDK bundle < 75KB gzipped
5. ✅ Swift SDK builds and passes on all target platforms
